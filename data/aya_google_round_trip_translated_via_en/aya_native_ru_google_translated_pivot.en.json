        "output": "It was one of the first serious attempts to overthrow the authoritarian rule of the Russian Tsar and introduce constitutional reforms in Russia. The uprising was suppressed, but left a deep mark on the history of Russia.\n\nMain aspects of the Decembrist uprising:\n\nParticipants: The bulk of the participants in the uprising consisted of Russian army officers, many of whom were inspired by the ideas of the Enlightenment and liberalism that they had absorbed in Europe. These officers came from the upper classes and were well educated.\n\nReasons: The Decembrists were dissatisfied with the absolute power of the Russian emperor and the lack of political freedoms. They sought to limit the power of the monarch, introduce a constitution and abolish serfdom.\n\nLeaders: The uprising had several leaders, including Pyotr Kakhovsky, Sergei Muravyov-Apostol and Pavel Pestel. They attempted a coup d'état, arming officers and calling for a change in the political system.\n\nSuppression: The uprising was quickly and brutally suppressed by government forces. Many participants were arrested, some were executed, and others were sentenced to long periods of exile.\n\nConsequences: The Decembrist Revolt did not lead to immediate changes in the political system of the Russian Empire, but it left a legacy of Enlightenment ideas and liberalism that became important in the movement towards political reform in Russia in the future.\n\nIn Russian history, the Decembrist uprising is often seen as the first serious attempt to change the political structure and it had a profound impact on subsequent historical events and reforms in the country.",

The intercommunal conflict acquired new severity during the years of perestroika (1987-1988), against the backdrop of a sharp rise in national movements in Armenia and Azerbaijan. By November - December 1988, the majority of residents of both republics were involved in this conflict, and it actually outgrew the scope of the local problem of Nagorno-Karabakh, turning into an open interethnic confrontation.\n\nIn 1991-1994, this confrontation led to large-scale military actions for control of Nagorno-Karabakh and some surrounding territories. On May 5, 1994, the Bishkek Protocol on a truce and ceasefire was signed between Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR), on the one hand, and Azerbaijan, on the other.\n\nThe result of the armed conflict was its “freezing” and the actual independence of the NKR from Azerbaijan. 92.5% of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region and the so-called “security zone” - areas administratively not subordinate to the autonomous region, but surrounding its territory - came under the control of the NKR. The conflict led to significant ethnic changes in the region. All Azerbaijanis and Kurds living here fled from the zone affected by hostilities. Almost all Armenians living outside the zone of Armenian control left Azerbaijan, and almost all Azerbaijanis left Armenia.",

During this period, his long-serving secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months of imprisonment on February 22, 1944, and Gandhi suffered a severe attack of malaria. While in prison, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then compiled and published a summary of the interview, cabled it to the mainstream press, announcing the sudden concessions Gandhi was prepared to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that he misrepresented what Gandhi actually said on a number of topics and falsely rejected the Quit India movement. Gandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary surgery; The Raj didn't want him to die in jail and anger the nation. He emerged from imprisonment onto a changed political scene - for example, the Muslim League, which had seemed marginal a few years earlier, \"now occupied the center of the political scene\" and the topic of Muhammad Ali Jinnah's campaign for Pakistan was the main topic of discussion. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence and the two men met several times over a two-week period in September 1944, where Gandhi pushed for a united religiously plural and independent India that included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. Jinnah rejected this proposal and instead insisted on dividing the subcontinent along religious lines to create a separate Muslim India (later Pakistan). These discussions continued until 1947. While Congress leaders languished in jail, other parties supported the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications opposed the brutal suppression of the Congress, but it had little control over events. At the end of the war, the British gave clear instructions that power would be transferred to the hands of the Indians. At this point, Gandhi canceled...

The oprichniki were Ivan's chosen confidants, and they had powers of power and terror. Their tasks were to pursue and destroy the enemies of Ivan the Terrible, carry out mass repressions and terror throughout Russia, as well as confiscate property and lands from rivals.\n\nThe guardsmen wore black clothes, and their symbol was a dog's head and a broom, which symbolized their ability to “cleanse” Russia of enemies and alleged traitors. One of the most famous and brutal events of this period was the “Oprichnina” in Moscow in 1570-1571, when the oprichniki carried out mass murders and looting, leading to many victims.\n\nThe oprichnina lasted only a few years, and in 1572 Ivan the Terrible dissolved the organization, partly due to international and domestic pressures, as well as the indignation of some of the Russian nobility and clergy.

Religiosity in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas. A 2017 estimate even shows that 37.0% of the German population was non-denominational. Islam is the second largest religion in the country. In the 2011 census, 1.9% of the census population (1.52 million people) reported their religion as Islam, but this figure is considered unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this religion (and other religions such as Judaism) were likely to take advantage of their the right not to answer a question. According to the Religious Studies Media and Information Service, there were between 4.4 and 4.7 million (about 5.5% of the population) in 2015. A study by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees found that the Muslim population grew by 1.2 million between 2011 and 2015, mainly due to immigration. Most Muslims are Sunni and Alevi from Turkey, but there are small numbers of Shia, Ahmadis and other faiths. Other religions that make up less than one percent of the German population are Buddhism with 270,000 adherents, Judaism with 200,000 adherents and Hinduism with about 100,000 adherents.

The oprichniki were Ivan's chosen confidants, and they had powers of power and terror. Their tasks were to pursue and destroy the enemies of Ivan the Terrible, carry out mass repressions and terror throughout Russia, as well as confiscate property and lands from rivals.\n\nThe guardsmen wore black clothes, and their symbol was a dog's head and a broom, which symbolized their ability to “cleanse” Russia of enemies and alleged traitors. One of the most famous and brutal events of this period was the “Oprichnina” in Moscow in 1570-1571, when the oprichniki carried out mass murders and looting, leading to many victims.\n\nThe oprichnina lasted only a few years, and in 1572 Ivan the Terrible dissolved the organization, partly due to international and domestic pressures, as well as the indignation of some of the Russian nobility and clergy.

Those who rejected innovation and preferred to preserve old rites and customs became known as \"Old Believers.\" The Old Believers became a broader and more diverse movement, encompassing various groups and sects, each of which could have its own interpretations and teachings.\n\nThe Old Believers considered themselves defenders of the true faith and practiced old church rituals that were approved before Nikon's reforms. They also refused to accept altered versions of the texts of church books and prayer books.\n\nBecause of their persistent opposition to the official church and state, the Old Believers faced persecution and discrimination at different periods of Russian history. Some Old Believer communities continue to exist today, and their numbers may vary depending on the region. The Old Believers remain an important part of Russian religious and cultural history.",

A 2017 estimate even shows that 37.0% of the German population was non-denominational. Islam is the second largest religion in the country. In the 2011 census, 1.9% of the census population (1.52 million people) reported their religion as Islam, but this figure is considered unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this religion (and other religions such as Judaism) were likely to take advantage of their the right not to answer a question. According to the Religious Studies Media and Information Service, there were between 4.4 and 4.7 million (about 5.5% of the population) in 2015. A study by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees found that the Muslim population grew by 1.2 million between 2011 and 2015, mainly due to immigration. Most Muslims are Sunni and Alevi from Turkey, but there are small numbers of Shia, Ahmadis and other faiths. Other religions that make up less than one percent of the German population are Buddhism with 270,000 adherents, Judaism with 200,000 adherents and Hinduism with about 100,000 adherents.

On May 5, 1994, the Bishkek Protocol on a truce and ceasefire was signed between Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) on one side and Azerbaijan on the other.\n\nThe result of the armed conflict was its \"freezing\" and the de facto independence of the NKR from Azerbaijan. 92.5% of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region and the so-called \"security zone\" - areas that were not administratively subordinate to the autonomous region, but surrounded its territory - came under the control of the NKR.

Pestel took part in Russia's wars against Napoleon, including the War of 1812. During his military career he achieved the rank of captain. Pestel became one of the main ideologists of the Decembrists and played an important role in the preparation and organization of the Decembrist uprising on December 14, 1825. He developed the project “Russia should be a republic” and believed that Russia should become a constitutional republic. Despite his important role in planning the uprising, Pestel was unable to participate in the event itself, as he was arrested a few days before the uprising due to a change in his plans and schemes. After his arrest, Pestel was put on trial. He was sentenced to death and hanged on July 13, 1826 in St. Petersburg.\n\nPavel Pestel left a legacy as one of the most important figures in the Decembrist movement and their ideologist.

It turned out that every two mayors who worked in neighboring cities before the reform ended up in neighboring cities after the reform. Prove that either there is a city in which the mayor did not change after the reform, or there are a couple of neighboring cities that exchanged mayors.\"",

Let Γ1 be the set of cities from which one road originates, and Γ be the set of other cities. Having started moving along different roads from a certain city, according to the condition, we cannot get to the same city twice, so someday we will end up moving in a city from the set Γ1. This means that the set Γ1 is non-empty. It is clear that for N ≥ 3 the set Γ is non-empty, and there are fewer than N cities in it.\n Let's call the importance of the mayor the number of cities neighboring the city where he works. By convention, the importance of each mayor did not decrease after the reform. In particular, the mayor of a city belonging to the set Γ, after the reform, became the mayor of some city from the set Γ, that is, as a result of the reform, mayors were also rearranged in the cities of the set Γ. It is clear that from each city A ∈ Γ one can get to any other city B ∈ Γ without visiting the cities of the set Γ1. Therefore, the set of cities Γ and the reform considered only for cities from Γ satisfy the conditions of the problem. Applying the induction assumption, we find that in the set Γ there is either a city in which the mayor did not change after the reform, or there is a pair of neighboring cities that exchanged mayors, which is what was required.",

This period of Russian history, when the oprichniki existed and acted, is called “Oprichnina”.\n\nIvan the Terrible founded the oprichnina in 1565 with the goal of strengthening his authority and suppressing real or perceived political opponents. The oprichniki were Ivan's chosen confidants, and they had powers of power and terror. Their tasks were to pursue and destroy the enemies of Ivan the Terrible, carry out mass repressions and terror throughout Russia, as well as confiscate property and lands from rivals.\n\nThe guardsmen wore black clothes, and their symbol was a dog's head and a broom, which symbolized their ability to “cleanse” Russia of enemies and alleged traitors. One of the most famous and brutal events of this period was the “Oprichnina” in Moscow in 1570-1571, when the oprichniki committed mass murders and robberies, leading to many victims.\n\nThe oprichnina lasted only a few years, and in 1572 Ivan the Terrible dissolved the organization, partly due to international and domestic pressures, as well as the indignation of some of the Russian nobility and clergy. The oprichnina left a difficult legacy in Russian history, and this period is considered one of the darkest in the history of Tsarist Russia.",

Her goal was to force the British to come to the negotiating table for Indian independence as soon as possible. The call for nonviolent resistance was voiced in Mahatma Gandhi's \"Act or Die\" speech, which found a strong response among the people.\n\nOn August 8, 1942, in Bombay's Gowalia Tank Park, Gandhi gave a speech that launched the campaign, and less than 24 hours later, key leaders of almost all levels of the Indian National Congress Party were arrested and imprisoned by the British. Gandhi was placed under house arrest in the Aga Khan's palace, which lasted two years. Other important Congress leaders were imprisoned in the Ahmednagar fort. The activities of the Congress were prohibited. Since all the leaders of the campaign were arrested, its progress became uncontrollable. Mass rallies, demonstrations and marches followed, and then strikes. Violence soon increased, with several bomb explosions, destruction and arson of government buildings, destruction of power plants and disruption of communications centers, causing chaos in some regions.\n\nThe authorities of British India took repressive measures against the rebels, including mass arrests and large fines. Hundreds of people died during the conflict, more than 100 thousand people were taken into custody. As a result, the movement was crushed, and the remaining leaders of the campaign were forced to go underground, broadcasting through underground radio stations and distributing pamphlets calling for continued struggle. Sensing a crisis in their power in India, the British decided to take Gandhi and other prominent Congress leaders on a battleship to South Africa or Yemen, but in the end they did not dare to do this.",
