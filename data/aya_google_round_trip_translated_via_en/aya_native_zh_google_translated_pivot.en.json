Therefore, the EU will be controlled by the United States and \"NATO\" in most areas, and must cooperate with the US strategy.\n2. The United States has already controlled Ukraine. Before the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the United States successfully planned and implemented the \"color revolution\" in Ukraine. And overthrew the former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Yanukovych. The several governments of Ukraine after the color revolution obeyed the United States and were willing to be vassals. At the instigation of the United States, they began to turn from \"pro-Russian\" to \"anti-Russian\".\n3. Ukraine itself asked to join \"NATO\". After Ukraine overthrew the \"pro-Russian\" regime, its diplomacy leaned towards the West. And it cooperated with the US and the West's strategy to contain Russia everywhere, and actively asked to join \"NATO\" in order to better integrate into the West, and was willing to let the West be used as a gun to deal with its \"mother country\" Russia.\n4. The West regards Ukraine as having strategic value. Obviously, Ukraine is a big country in Europe and is another powerful \"fighter\" that the United States and the West are very worthy of \"cultivating\" to defeat Russia. Because Ukraine has a certain weight that can \"fight\" with Russia, the EU will spare no effort to help Ukraine in this Russia-Ukraine conflict, with the goal of completely defeating Russia through this battle.",

When it rains or after the rain, the air is filled with countless small water droplets that can deflect sunlight. When sunlight passes through water droplets, it not only changes the direction of travel, but is also decomposed into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple colors. If the angle is right, it becomes the rainbow we see.\n\n　　The size of the water droplets in the air determines the brightness of the rainbow. The larger the water droplets, the brighter the rainbow, and the smaller the water droplets, the lighter the rainbow. Thunderstorms or showers often occur in summer. These rains are not very widespread. It is often the case that the sun rises over a certain area when it rains here. When the sun shines on the small water droplets that remain in the air after the rain, a beautiful rainbow appears.\n\nComparatively speaking, the air is dry in winter, and there is less chance of rain. Most of the time, it snows, and snowfall does not form a rainbow, so rainbows are unlikely to appear in winter. However, in rare cases, when the sky has the right conditions for the formation of a rainbow, a rainbow may also appear.",

However, the four heroes of the time, such as Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lu Meng, and Lu Xun, were truly the backbone of the country and the ministers who depended on the survival of the country. Since ancient times, generals have always been proud of their own abilities and hated those who were better than themselves, but these wise men were not like that. When Sun Quan first took charge of the affairs, Su wanted to return to the north, but Yu stopped him and recommended him to Quan, saying, \"Su's talent is suitable for assisting the time, and we should seek more people to succeed in the cause.\" Later, Yu wrote to Quan before his death, saying, \"Lu Su is loyal and brave, and he is not careless in dealing with things. If he replaces Yu, he will be immortal after his death!\" Su then replaced Yu in commanding the army. Lu Meng was the magistrate of Xunyang. When Su saw him, he said, \"Your talent and strategy are no longer the same as Wu's A Meng.\" He then paid homage to Meng's mother, became friends, and left. Meng then replaced Su. Meng was in Lukou, but he claimed to be ill and returned. Sun Quan asked, \"Who can replace him?\" Meng said, \"Lu Xun is thoughtful and capable of taking on important tasks. Judging from his planning and consideration, he will eventually be able to take on important tasks and will not make such mistakes again.\" So Xun replaced Meng.

The heroes of the Eastern Wu at that time (such as Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lu Meng, and Lu Xun, who were the so-called backbone of the country at that time) were all ministers who could live and die with the country. However, since ancient times, most generals and commanders considered themselves to be virtuous and feared that there would be someone better than them. But these virtuous people were not like this. When Sun Quan just took over the power, Lu Su (a northerner) wanted to go to Jiangbei (to join Cao Cao), but Yu stopped him and recommended him to Sun Quan: \"Su is a talented person who should assist the time. We should look for his peers to achieve success.\" Later, Yu wrote a letter to Sun Quan before his death: \"Lu Su is loyal and brave, and he is meticulous in dealing with things. If you can use him to replace me, I will never regret it!\" Su then replaced Yu to lead the army. When Lu Meng was appointed as the prefect of Xunyang, Su said to him, \"You are no longer as talented as the Wu general A Meng (because Lu Meng has learned a lot of knowledge).\" Then he paid respect to Lu Meng's mother, became friends and left. Later, Lu Meng also replaced Lu Su in charge of the army. Lu Meng resigned due to illness in Lukou. Quan asked, \"Who can replace you?\" Meng said, \"Lu Xun is thoughtful and capable of taking on important tasks.

        "output": "The vast bullfighting field was bustling with people. The handsome bullfighters were wearing red clothes with gold trims and waving red cloths in their hands. The bulls were charging around like crazy. The bulls, weighing hundreds to thousands of kilograms, seemed to have a grudge against the red cloth and kept charging with all their strength. So, we naturally thought that red was the color that could provoke the bulls to get angry. Is this really the case?\n\nNo. Bulls are actually standard color blind. It doesn't matter whether you wave a red cloth or a white cloth in front of them. There are several reasons why bulls get angry. First, this kind of bull is a North African bull with a very aggressive temperament; second, it has been locked in the pen for a long time and has long been impatient; third and most importantly, the bullfighter waving the cloth in front of it makes it very uncomfortable. Bulls are very sensitive to moving things, and the waving cloth makes it think it is an enemy, so it rushes over without thinking, wanting to show off its power. If the opponent does not move, for example, the bullfighter poses in a very elegant manner, the bull will not pay any attention to him.\n\n　　So why do bullfighters use red cloth to fight bulls? That's because red is more stimulating to the human eye, and the spectators in the field are more likely to be excited when they see red. When the audience is excited, the performance will be particularly effective. Therefore, the red cloth is not used to amuse the cow, but to amuse the audience.",

Representatives of this art movement include Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, etc. The artists of the Indian School are characterized by capturing the changes of light and color at different moments, emphasizing the expression of natural scenery and daily life. The name comes from an art critic who used the term \"Indian School\" to describe their works when commenting on Monet's paintings.\n\nAlthough the Indian School was initially coldly received, it gradually gained widespread recognition and had a profound influence on later modern art. The characteristics of this art movement include the theme of natural light and color changes, and the use of pointillism to present more vivid pictures. It is regarded as one of the important preludes to Impressionism and modern art.",

        "instruction": "Translate the following ancient text:\n\nThe six states were destroyed, not because of their disadvantageous soldiers or bad fighting skills, but because of their bribery of Qin. Bribing Qin and losing strength is the way to destruction. Some people say: Did the six states lose each other because they bribed Qin? Answer: Those who did not bribe lost because of those who bribed, because they lost strong support and could not survive alone. Therefore, it is said that the fault lies in bribing Qin.\n\nIn addition to the conquests by Qin, it also gained small towns and large cities. Compared with what Qin gained by winning, it was actually a hundred times more; what the princes lost was actually a hundred times more than what they lost by losing. Therefore, what Qin wanted most and what the princes worried about most was not fighting. Think of your ancestors, who braved the frost and dew and cut through thorns to get a piece of land. The descendants did not care much about it and gave it to others as if it were a waste of grass. Today I ceded five cities, tomorrow I ceded ten cities, and then I could sleep peacefully for one night. I got up and looked around, and the Qin army arrived again. However, the land of the princes is limited, and the tyrannical Qin is insatiable. The more it serves, the more urgent it invades. Therefore, the victory or defeat of the strong and the weak has been determined without fighting. As for *, it is reasonable. The ancients said: \"To serve Qin with land is like holding firewood to put out a fire. If the firewood is not exhausted, the fire will not go out.\" This is right.\n\n　　The people of Qi never bribed Qin, but they were eventually destroyed after the five countries. Why? They were with Ying and did not help the five countries. After the five countries were lost, Qi was also doomed. The rulers of Yan and Zhao had a long-term strategy and were able to defend their land. They did not bribe Qin. Therefore, although Yan was a small country, it was destroyed. This is the effect of using military force. It was not until Dan used Jing Qing as a plan that the disaster came. Zhao fought five times with Qin, lost two and won three. Later, Qin attacked Zhao twice, and Li Mu defeated them successively. When Mu was executed for slander, Handan became a county. It was a pity that his military use did not last. Moreover, Yan and Zhao were in a situation where Qin was about to destroy them. They were isolated and weak in intelligence. They were defeated and perished. It was really a last resort. If the three countries had loved their own land, the people of Qi had not attached themselves to Qin, the assassins had not succeeded, and the good generals were still there, then the number of victories and defeats, the reason for survival and destruction, should be compared with Qin, it might not be easy to measure.\n\n　　Alas! If you bribe Qin with land to enfeoff the world's counselors, serve Qin with your heart to treat the world's geniuses, and work together to the west, I am afraid that the Qin people will not be able to swallow it. Sad! With such a strong position, you are robbed by the accumulated power of Qin, and you are being cut down day by day and month by month, and are heading for destruction. Those who govern the country should not let themselves be robbed by the accumulated power!\n\n　　The six countries and Qin were all vassal states. Their power was weaker than Qin, but they still had the potential to defeat it without bribery. If you follow the example of the six countries' destruction and fall, you will be inferior to the six countries.",
        "output": "The demise of the six states was not because their weapons were not sharp or they fought badly, but because they bribed Qin with land. Bribing Qin with land reduced their own strength, which was the reason for their demise. Someone asked: \"The six states perished one after another, was it all because of bribing Qin?\" (The answer) was: \"The states that did not bribe Qin perished because of the states that bribed Qin. The reason was that the states that did not bribe Qin lost strong foreign aid and could not survive on their own. So it is said that the problem was bribing Qin.\"\n\nIn addition to using wars to seize land, Qin also accepted bribes from the princes. The small ones got towns and the big ones got cities. Comparing the land Qin received from bribes with the land it received from defeating other states, the former was actually a hundred times more. The land lost by the princes of the six states (bribing Qin) was actually a hundred times more than the land lost in defeat. So what Qin wanted most and what the princes of the six states were most worried about was not war. Thinking of their ancestors and fathers, braving the cold and rain, cutting through thorns and brambles, they only had a little land. Their descendants did not cherish the land very much, and gave it all to others, just like throwing away grass. Cut off five cities today, cut off ten cities tomorrow, and then you can sleep peacefully. When you get up tomorrow and look at the borders around, the Qin army is coming again. In this case, the land of the princes is limited, and the desire of the violent Qin will never be satisfied. The more (the princes) give him, the more urgent he will invade. So there is no need for war, who is strong and who is weak, who wins and who loses has been decided. When it comes to destruction, the truth is like this. The ancients said: \"Using land to serve Qin is like holding firewood to put out a fire. The fire will not go out until the firewood is burned out.\" This is very correct.\n\n　　Qi never bribed Qin, (but) it eventually perished with the five countries. Why? (Because Qi) was friendly with Qin and did not help the other five countries. The five states had already perished, so Qi was not immune. The rulers of Yan and Zhao had long-term strategies at first, and were able to defend their territories, uphold justice, and not bribe Qin. Therefore, although Yan was a small state, it was destroyed later. This was the effect of using military force to resist Qin. Later, when Prince Dan of Yan sent Jing Ke to assassinate the King of Qin as a strategy to deal with Qin, it brought about the disaster of (destruction). Zhao had fought with Qin five times, lost two battles and won three. Later, Qin attacked Zhao twice. (Zhao general) Li Mu repelled Qin's attacks one after another. When Li Mu was killed due to false accusations, (Zhao's capital) Handan became (a Qin) county. Unfortunately, Zhao could not persist in resisting Qin with force. Moreover, Yan and Zhao were at a time when Qin was about to wipe out other countries. It can be said that they had run out of wisdom and strategies, and their national situation was isolated and critical. They were defeated and perished. It was indeed a last resort. If Han, Wei, and Chu all cherished their land, Qi did not rely on Qin, and the assassin of Yan did not go and Li Mu, the good general of Zhao, was still alive, then the fate of victory and defeat, the logic of survival and death, if compared with Qin, might not be easy to measure.\n\nAlas! If the six states used the land bribed by Qin to grant the counselors of the world, used the heart of serving Qin to treat the geniuses of the world, and worked together to go west (to deal with Qin), then I am afraid that the Qin people would not be able to swallow their food. It is so sad! With such a favorable situation, they were coerced by the long-standing power of Qin, ceding land every day and every month, and even heading for destruction. People who govern the country should not be coerced by the long-standing power!\n\nThe six states and Qin were all vassal states. Their power was weaker than that of Qin, but they still had the advantage of defeating Qin without bribing it. If a country as big as this follows the example of the six kingdoms that were destroyed, it will be no match for the six kingdoms.",

He said, \"Come and get it another day.\" After several years, there was no news from him. He heard that his nephew came to the south for other things, not to pick up the box.

When He Yue was teaching in the family of an official, the official sometimes had to go to the capital and deposited a box with He Yue, which contained several hundred taels of silver.

        "output": "Answer: In terms of custody, the principle of which party's custody is beneficial to the child's growth should be followed. When determining custody, the court will comprehensively consider the child's current living conditions, the work income and morality of both spouses, and whether the child has been raised by one parent. In my country, according to the legal provisions on marriage and family and relevant judicial interpretations, the establishment of direct custody of minors mainly has the following principles:\n\n1. The principle is to benefit the physical and mental health of children and protect the legitimate rights and interests of children;\n\n2. Children in the breastfeeding period should be raised by the breastfeeding mother;\n\n3. For children after the breastfeeding period, the negotiation between the two parties is given priority. When no agreement can be reached, the judgment is supplemented by the rights and interests of the children and the specific circumstances of both parties;\n\n4. For minors over ten years old, if there is a dispute over whether to live with the father or mother, the principle is to appropriately consider the opinions of the minors. The party who does not raise the child should pay alimony, which is generally 20-30% of the income of the party who does not raise the child. Alimony includes living expenses, education expenses, medical expenses, etc. The specific alimony should be determined based on the local living standards and the actual living expenses of the child.\nArticle 1084 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China: The relationship between parents and children does not disappear due to the divorce of parents. After divorce, children are still the children of both parents regardless of whether they are directly raised by the father or the mother.\nAfter divorce, parents still have the right and obligation to raise, educate and protect their children.\nAfter divorce, children under the age of two shall be raised directly by the mother in principle. For children over the age of two, if the parents cannot reach an agreement on the issue of raising, the People's Court shall make a judgment based on the specific circumstances of both parties and in accordance with the principle of what is most beneficial to the minor children. If the child is over the age of eight, his or her true wishes shall be respected.",

IAM consists of systems and processes that allow IT administrators to assign a single digital identity to each entity, authenticate them at login, authorize them to access designated resources, and monitor and manage those identities throughout their lifecycle.\n\nIAM is no longer just for employees. Organizations must be able to provide secure access to contractors and business partners, remote and mobile users, and customers. With digital transformation, identities are also being assigned to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, robots, and pieces of code, such as APIs or microservices. Multi-cloud hybrid IT environments and software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions further complicate the IAM landscape.\n\nBecause it sits between users and critical corporate assets, identity and access management is a key component of any enterprise security program. It helps prevent user credentials from being compromised and passwords from being easily cracked, which are common network entry points for criminal hackers looking to plant ransomware or steal data.\n\nIf implemented properly, IAM helps ensure business productivity and the smooth operation of digital systems. Employees can work seamlessly regardless of where they are, while centralized management ensures they only access the specific resources they need to do their jobs. Opening systems to customers, contractors, and suppliers can increase efficiency and reduce costs.",

        "output": "There are many different opinions about the reasons why Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Data found after the war show that the Pearl Harbor incident was actually an energy war, or more precisely, it was an extreme measure taken by Japan because of the oil embargo imposed by the United States on it.\n\nThe United States hopes to contain Japan by blocking energy supply\n\nAs an important strategic material, oil has an inextricable relationship with war. As an island country, Japan is short of resources, and energy shortage has become its fatal weakness in dominating the world. In the late 1930s, 90% of Japan's domestic oil demand came from imports, and 85% of it came from the United States, the most important oil exporter at the time.\n\nBefore the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan had been fighting a four-year war on the Asian continent with the aim of plundering the rich natural resources there.\n\nJapan's aggression against Asian countries obviously posed a threat to the United States' Far East interests. However, isolationism in the United States also put the Roosevelt government in a dilemma. Isolationists believed that on the one hand, military aid could not be provided to countries threatened by war in the world, and on the other hand, economic sanctions could not be imposed on the aggressor countries. Moreover, under pressure from the British government and the US Congress, President Roosevelt was advised not to engage in military conflict with Japan in the Pacific, so as to avoid being unable to provide assistance to the Allies in the future. This would also divert public attention and make it impossible to pay attention to Hitler's invasion plan.\n\nIn July 1940, the United States passed the Export Control Act, which gave President Roosevelt an excuse to retaliate against Japan's wanton expansion in Asia. When the Japanese began their invasion of northern Indochina in September 1940, President Roosevelt used the act to impose a ban on the export of scrap iron and steel to Japan. Soon after, he imposed an embargo on aviation fuel and lubricants, claiming that these supplies could only be exported to Britain and other Western Hemisphere countries.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese were also thinking and began to reassess their foreign policy. The Japanese military, especially the military leadership, had exerted a lot of adverse influence on foreign policy since the establishment of the pseudo-Manchukuo in northeastern China. At the same time, the military leadership was also the main force supporting an alliance with Germany and Italy. They advocated prolonging the war in China and advancing further into southern Asia to realize their dream of an energy-self-sufficient empire. In the summer of 1940, Duke Konoe Fumimaro became Prime Minister of Japan. The Konoe Cabinet acquiesced to the military's further expansion in Asia while working to reach a reconciliation with the United States. However, the Konoe Cabinet authorized the military to occupy bases in French Indochina and signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, which made it impossible for President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull to make any concessions in the negotiations.\nIn the winter of 1940, the United States became increasingly concerned about the development of the situation after the British transatlantic energy supply line was devastated by German submarines. In April 1941, Germany occupied Yugoslavia and Greece and inflicted heavy losses on British forces in Crete and North Africa. President Roosevelt had to order the extension of the neutral zone in the Atlantic Ocean and the extension of the cruise line further east to prevent Hitler's attack. In May, President Roosevelt announced the further strengthening of submarine tracking and escort in the region and dispatched the Pacific Fleet to reinforce the Atlantic Fleet. The United States therefore declared a state of emergency, and Washington placed support for Britain in an indisputable position of importance.",

The Xiongnu thought Wu was a god, so they moved Wu to an uninhabited place on the north sea and made him herd rams. He could only return home when the rams gave milk. They separated his officials such as Chang Hui and sent them to other places. When Wu arrived at the sea, he could not get food, so he dug up wild mice, removed the grass and seeds, and ate them.

The Xiongnu thought it was a miracle, so they moved Su Wu to an uninhabited place by the North Sea and asked him to herd rams, saying that he could only return to the Han Dynasty after the rams gave birth to lambs. At the same time, they settled his subordinates and his entourage, including Chang Hui, in other places. After Su Wu moved to the North Sea, food could not be transported, so he could only eat wild fruits stored by wild mice. He herded sheep with the Han court's talisman, holding it when he slept and got up, so that all the yak tail hair tied to the talisman fell off.",

        "instruction": "Translate the following ancient Chinese into modern Chinese characters:\nZi Mozi said: \"The reason why a benevolent person works is to promote the benefits of the world and eliminate the harm of the world. This is what he does.\" Then what are the benefits of the world? What are the harms of the world? Zi Mozi said: \"Now if countries attack each other, families usurp each other, people rob each other, the monarch and ministers are not loyal, fathers and sons are not kind and filial, and brothers are not harmonious, this is the harm of the world.\"\n\nThen why do we need to observe this harm? Is it because of lack of love? Mozi said: \"It is born out of not loving each other. Now the princes only know how to love their own country, not other countries, so they do not hesitate to raise their own country to attack other countries. Now the head of a family only knows how to love his family, not other families, so they do not hesitate to raise their own family to usurp other families. Now people only know how to love themselves, not other bodies, so they do not hesitate to raise their own bodies to harm other bodies. Therefore, if the princes do not love each other, they will inevitably fight in the wild, if the heads of a family do not love each other, they will inevitably usurp each other, if people do not love each other, they will inevitably harm each other, if the ruler and his subjects do not love each other, they will not be kind and loyal, if the father and son do not love each other, they will not be kind and filial, if the brothers do not love each other, they will not be harmonious. If all people in the world do not love each other, the strong will surely oppress the weak, the rich will surely insult the poor, the noble will surely bully the humble, and the cunning will surely deceive the foolish. All the disasters, usurpations and resentments in the world arise from not loving each other, so the benevolent condemn it.\"\n\n　　Since it is condemned, how can it be changed? Mozi said: \"Replace it with the law of loving each other and benefiting each other.\" Then what can we do with the law of loving each other and benefiting each other? Mozi said: \"Treat other people's countries as if they were your own, treat other people's families as if they were your own, and treat other people's bodies as if they were your own. Therefore, princes love each other and do not fight in the wild, heads of families love each other and do not usurp each other, people love each other and do not rob each other, rulers and ministers love each other and are loyal, fathers and sons love each other and are kind and filial, and brothers love each other and are harmonious. All people in the world love each other, the strong do not oppress the weak, the majority do not rob the minority, the rich do not insult the poor, the noble do not bully the humble, and the cunning do not deceive the foolish. All the disasters, usurpations and resentments in the world that can be prevented are born out of love, and this is why the benevolent praise them.\"\n\n　　However, the gentlemen of the world today say: Yes, if you can have both, then it is good. However, it is the reason that is the most difficult thing in the world. \"Mozi said: \"The scholars and gentlemen in the world just don't know the benefits and the reasons. Now, if you attack a city and fight in the field, and kill yourself for the sake of reputation, this is difficult for the people of the world. If the king persuades them, the scholars can do it. What's more, loving each other and benefiting each other is different from this! If you love others, others will love you back; if you benefit others, others will benefit you back; if you hate others, others will hate you back; if you harm others, others will harm you back. Why is this difficult? It's just that the rulers don't regard it as a policy and the scholars don't regard it as a practice. In the past Duke Wen of Jin liked his men to wear bad clothes, so all his ministers wore sheepskin coats, leather belts with swords, and silk hats. They went in to see the king and went out to the court. Why was that? The king liked them, so the ministers did what they did. In the past, King Ling of Chu liked his men to be meticulous, so all his ministers kept their meals as a rule, took a deep breath before putting on their belts, and stood up by the wall. After a year, the court was dark. Why was that? The king liked them, so the ministers were able to do what they did. In the past, King Gou Jian of Yue liked his men to be brave, so he trained his ministers. He secretly had his men burn boats and set them on fire to test his men, saying, \"All the treasures of Yue are here!\" The king of Yue personally beat the drums The scholars advanced. When the scholars heard the drums, they were scattered and ran in disorder. More than a hundred people died by stepping into the fire. The King of Yue beat the gongs and drove them back. \"Therefore, Master Mozi said, \"As for eating less and wearing worse clothes, and killing oneself for fame, this is difficult for all the people in the world. If the king persuades them, everyone can do it. What's more, loving and benefiting each other is different from this. If you love others, others will also love you; if you benefit others, others will also benefit you; if you hate others, others will also hate you; if you harm others, others will also harm you. Why is this difficult? It's just that scholars don't think of it as a policy and scholars don't think of it as a practice.\"",
        "output": "Mozi said: \"The principle of a benevolent man in handling affairs must be to promote benefits and eliminate harm for the world, and to handle affairs based on this principle.\" If so, what is the benefit of the world, and what is the harm of the world? Mozi said: \"Now, if countries attack each other, families plunder each other, people harm each other, monarchs and ministers do not show favor and loyalty to each other, fathers and sons do not love and respect each other, and brothers do not get along and coordinate with each other, these are all harms of the world.\"\n\nIf so, then examine why these public harms are caused? Is it caused by not loving each other? Mozi said: \"It is caused by not loving each other.\" The princes now only know how to love their own country, not other countries, so they unscrupulously mobilize the power of their own country to attack other countries. The head of the family now only knows how to love his own family, not other families, so he unscrupulously mobilizes the power of his own family to plunder other families. People now only know how to love themselves, not others, so they unscrupulously use their whole body to harm others. Therefore, if the princes do not love each other, there will inevitably be field wars; if the heads of families do not love each other, they will inevitably plunder each other; if people do not love each other, they will inevitably harm each other; if the monarch and the ministers do not love each other, they will inevitably not show favor and loyalty to each other; if the father and the son do not love each other, they will inevitably not be kind and filial to each other; if the brothers do not love each other, they will inevitably not be harmonious and coordinated with each other. If people in the world do not love each other, the strong will inevitably control the weak, the rich will inevitably bully the poor, the noble will inevitably look down on the humble, and the cunning will inevitably deceive the stupid. All the causes of disasters, plunder, complaints, and resentment in the world are caused by not loving each other. Therefore, the benevolent think it is wrong.\n\n　　Since it is considered wrong not to love each other, how can it be changed? Mozi said: \"Change it by having everyone love each other and benefit each other.\" If this is the case, then how should people love each other and benefit each other? Mozi said: \"Treat other countries as if they were your own countries, treat other families as if they were your own families, and treat other people's bodies as if they were your own bodies.\" Therefore, if the princes love each other, there will be no field wars; if the heads of families love each other, there will be no plundering; if people love each other, they will not harm each other; if the monarch and his subjects love each other, they will be kind and loyal to each other; if fathers and sons love each other, they will be kind and filial to each other; if brothers love each other, they will be harmonious and coordinated with each other. If people in the world love each other, the strong will not control the weak, the majority will not force the minority, the rich will not bully the poor, the noble will not look down on the humble, and the cunning will not deceive the stupid. All the causes of the world's disasters, plunder, complaints, and resentment that can prevent them from happening are produced because of love. Therefore, the benevolent praise it.\n\nHowever, the scholars and gentlemen of the world now say: \"Yes! Universal love is good. Even so, it is a difficult and tedious thing to do in the world.\" Mozi said: \"The scholars and gentlemen of the world just can't distinguish the benefits of universal love and the reasons for universal love. Now, for example, attacking a city and fighting in the field, killing for fame, these are things that are difficult for the people of the world to do. But if the monarch likes, then the scholars can do it. Compared with this, universal love and mutual benefit are completely different (good things). Anyone who loves others, others will also follow Love him; those who benefit others, others will benefit him immediately; those who hate others, others will hate him immediately; those who harm others, others will harm him immediately. What is the difficulty in practicing this kind of universal love? It is just because those in high positions do not use it in politics, and scholars do not use it in practice. \"In the past, Duke Wen of Jin liked scholars to wear bad clothes, so Duke Wen's ministers all wore fur coats made of ewe skin, wrapped cowhide belts around their waists to hang swords, and wore hats made of cooked silk on their heads. (This dress) can be used to serve the monarch and go to and from the court. Why is this? Because the monarch likes this, so the ministers do this. In the past, King Ling of Chu liked people with thin waists, so King Ling's ministers ate a meal to diet, held their breath before tying their belts, and held on to the wall before standing up. After a year, the ministers in the court were (so thin that their faces were dark) with hunger. Why is this? Because the monarch likes this, so the ministers can do this. In the past, King Gou Jian of Yue loved his soldiers to be brave. When he trained his officials, he first gathered them together and set fire to the ship. He tested his soldiers by saying, \"The treasures of Yue are all in this ship.\" The King of Yue beat the drum himself and ordered his soldiers to advance. When the soldiers heard the drum, they rushed forward and disrupted the team. More than a hundred of his close officials died in the fire. The King of Yue then sounded the horn and asked them to retreat. Therefore, Mozi said, \"It is difficult for ordinary people to do such things as eating less, wearing bad clothes, and sacrificing their lives to gain fame. If the monarch likes it, then the officials can do it. Moreover, loving and benefiting each other is different from this. Those who love others will be loved by others; those who benefit others will be benefited by others; those who hate others will be hated by others; those who harm others will be harmed by others. What is so difficult about this kind of love? It is just that those in high positions do not use it in politics, and the officials do not use it in practice.\"",

All the wise men were present, young and old gathered. There are high mountains and steep ridges, lush forests and bamboos in this place; there are also clear and turbulent streams, reflecting the left and right, and we use them as flowing wine cups and winding waters, and sit in the second row. Although there is no grand music of stringed instruments and pipes, a cup of wine and a poem are enough to express my deep feelings.\n\nOn this day, the sky is clear and the air is fresh, and the breeze is gentle. Looking up at the vastness of the universe and looking down at the abundance of species, we can enjoy the sight and feel the entertainment of hearing and vision, which is really enjoyable.\n\nThe ladies are together, looking up and down for a lifetime, some take what they want and understand the words in a room; some rely on their trust and let go of their bodies. Although their interests are different, and their calmness and restlessness are different, when they are happy with what they encounter and temporarily get what they want, they are happy and content, and they don’t know that old age is coming. When I am tired of what I am doing, my emotions change with the situation, and I feel sad. What I used to enjoy has become a thing of the past, but I still can't help but feel sad. Moreover, life and death are subject to change, and will eventually end. The ancients said: \"Life and death are also great.\" Isn't it painful! (I don't know that old age is coming. Another work is: I never knew that old age is coming)\n\nWhenever I read the reasons for the ancients' emotions, I feel like I have found a soulmate. I always sigh and lament when reading the writings, and I can't express it in words. I know that the death and life are absurd, and the Qi Pengshang is a fabrication. People in the future will look at the present as we look at the past. How sad! Therefore, I list the people of the time and record what they said. Although the times are different and the events are different, the reason for their emotions is the same. People in the future will also be moved by this article.",
        "output": "In the ninth year of Yonghe, in the year of Guichou, in the early March, we gathered at the Lanting in Shanyin City, Kuaiji County, to perform the ritual of purification. Many wise men and capable people gathered here, both old and young. The Lanting has high peaks, dense and lush trees and bamboo groves; there are also clear and turbulent waters, which shine and surround the pavilion on both sides. We diverted the water as a circular channel to float wine cups, and sat in a row beside the winding water. Although there was no grand occasion of orchestral performance, drinking wine and writing poems were enough to express the deep and hidden feelings.\n\n　　On this day, the weather was clear and the breeze was blowing. Looking up at the vast sky and looking down at the numerous things on the earth, it was enough to stretch my eyes and broaden my mind, enough to enjoy the visual and auditory pleasure, and it was really happy.\n\n　　People interact with each other and spend their lives quickly. Some people talk about their ambitions in the room; they place their feelings on the things they like, and live a life without restraint and unfettered. Although they have different hobbies, and their quietness and restlessness are different, when they are happy with the things they touch, they feel contented, happy and satisfied for a while, and they don’t even know that aging is coming. When they get tired of the things they like, their mood changes with the current situation, and they feel sad. The things they liked in the past have become old in a blink of an eye, and they can’t help but feel touched by them. Moreover, the length of life is left to fate, and it will eventually be destroyed. The ancients said: \"Life and death are a big thing after all.\" How can it not make people sad? \n\nWhenever I see the reasons for the predecessors' emotions and sighs, they match my sighs like a match. I can't help sighing and feeling sad when facing their articles, but I can't explain it clearly in my heart. I know that the saying that equates life and death is untrue, and the saying that equates longevity with sex is false. The future generations will look upon the present people just as the present people look upon the past generations. How sad! So the people who attended the gathering were recorded one by one, and the poems they wrote. Even though the times have changed and the things are different, the reasons that triggered people's emotions and their thoughts and interests are the same. Readers of the future generations will also be moved by the poems and essays of this gathering.",

When their leaf buds and flower buds are pulled out of the mud, because their surface is protected by wax, it is difficult for mud and dirty water to stick to them.

They slept together. In the middle of the night, he heard the cock crowing, kicked Kun awake and said, \"This is not a bad sound!\" Then he started to dance. When crossing the Yangtze River, the left prime minister Rui appointed him as the military advisor. Ti lived in Jingkou and gathered brave men. He said to Rui, \"The chaos of the Jin Dynasty was not caused by the lack of justice of the emperor and the resentment of the people. It was caused by the struggle for power among the royal family, and the Rongdi took advantage of the opportunity to poison the Central Plains. Now that the remaining people have been brutally attacked, people want to fight for themselves. If the king can really order the generals to go out and let people like Ti lead them to recover the Central Plains, the heroes of the counties and states will surely respond to the call!\" Rui had no ambition to fight in the north, so he appointed Ti as the general of strength and the governor of Yuzhou, and gave him food for a thousand people and three thousand pieces of cloth, but no armor and weapons, so that he could recruit himself. Ti led more than a hundred of his followers across the river. When they were in the middle of the river, they struck the oars and swore, \"If Zu Ti cannot clear the Central Plains and restore the river, he will be as bad as the Yangtze River!\" Then he stationed in Huaiyin, started smelting and casting soldiers, and recruited more than 2,000 people before advancing.",

When he heard the crowing of a cock in the middle of the night, he kicked Liu Kun awake and said, \"Isn't this a disgusting sound?\" Then he got up and danced with a sword. After crossing the river, the left prime minister Sima Rui made him the military advisor. Zu Ti lived in Jingkou and gathered strong and brave warriors. He said to Sima Rui, \"The turmoil in the Jin Dynasty was not caused by the monarch's unjust behavior, which made the ministers resentful and rebellious, but rather the struggle for power among the royal relatives and the killing of each other. This allowed the Rongdi people to take advantage of the opportunity and spread the scourge throughout the Central Plains. Now that the remnants of the Jin Dynasty have been devastated and harmed, everyone wants to strengthen themselves. Your Majesty can indeed send generals to lead the troops and let people like me lead the army to recover the Central Plains. Heroes from all over the country will surely respond to the call!\" Sima Rui had no ambition to march north, and after listening to Zu Ti's words, he appointed Zu Ti as General Fenwei and Governor of Yuzhou, and only allocated him food for a thousand people and three thousand pieces of cloth, but no weapons, allowing Zu Ti to find a way to recruit them himself. Zu Ti led his private army of more than one hundred households across the Yangtze River. While beating the oars in the river, he said, \"If Zu Ti cannot bring peace to the Central Plains and succeed in the restoration, he will be like the great river, going there without return!\" So he stationed in Huaiyin, built a furnace to smelt and cast weapons, recruited more than 2,000 people, and then continued to move forward.",

In this case, people are worried about risks and uncertainties, and may have psychological barriers and obstacles. For example, a person wants to learn a new skill, but is afraid to try to learn it because of concerns about his performance or fear of failure.\nIn contrast, \"can't do\" usually means that he cannot do something due to objective conditions or limitations. In this case, people have a certain understanding of their own abilities or resources, so they will clearly know that they cannot do something. For example, a person wants to participate in a job that requires specific skills, but cannot do it because he does not have this skill.\n\"Don't dare to do\" and \"can't do\" are not absolute classifications, but a relative state. Sometimes, people may be afraid and unable to do something, or they may be afraid because they cannot do something. Therefore, we need to analyze and judge in specific situations to determine the specific reasons and limitations.\nUltimately, solving the problems of \"don't dare to do\" and \"can't do\" requires different methods and strategies according to the specific situation. If you don't dare to do it because of fear, you can gradually expand your comfort zone and take some appropriate actions to increase your confidence and courage. If you can't do it because of objective conditions, you can find other ways and methods to achieve your goals. In either case, you need to have the courage to face your own obstacles and difficulties, and actively look for solutions to achieve your goals and values.",

However, the four heroes of the time, such as Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lu Meng, and Lu Xun, were truly the backbone of the country and the ministers who depended on the survival of the country. Since ancient times, generals have always been proud of their own abilities and hated those who were better than themselves, but these wise men were not like that. When Sun Quan first took charge of the government, Su wanted to return to the north, but Yu stopped him and recommended him to Quan, saying, \"Su's talent is suitable for assisting the time, and we should seek more people to succeed in the cause.\" Later, Yu wrote to Quan before his death, saying, \"Lu Su is loyal and brave, and he is not sloppy in dealing with things. If he replaces Yu, he will be immortal after his death!\" Su then replaced Yu in commanding the army. Lu Meng was the magistrate of Xunyang. When Su saw him, he said, \"Your talent and strategy are no longer the same as A Meng from Wu.\" He then paid homage to Meng's mother, became friends, and said goodbye. Meng then replaced Su. Meng was in Lukou, but he claimed to be ill and returned. Sun Quan asked, \"Who can replace him?\" Meng said, \"Lu Xun is thoughtful and capable of taking on important tasks. Judging from his planning and consideration, he will eventually be able to take on important tasks and will not make such mistakes again.\" So Xun replaced Meng. The four of them succeeded each other and lived in the west for thirty or forty years. They were famous generals and defeated Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Guan Yu. Although they promoted each other, Sun Quan entrusted them with his heart. The reason why Wu became what it is is not accidental.",

The heroes of the Eastern Wu at that time (such as Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lu Meng, and Lu Xun, who were the so-called backbone of the country at that time) were all ministers who could live and die with the country. However, since ancient times, most generals and commanders considered themselves to be virtuous and feared that there would be someone better than them. But these virtuous people were not like this. When Sun Quan just took over the power, Lu Su (a northerner) wanted to go to Jiangbei (to join Cao Cao), but Yu stopped him and recommended him to Sun Quan: \"Su Su is a talent suitable for assisting the time, and we should seek his peers to achieve success.\" Later, Yu wrote a letter to Sun Quan before his death: \"Lu Su is loyal and brave, and he is meticulous in dealing with things. If I can use him to replace me, I will never regret it!\" Su then replaced Yu to command the army. Lu Meng was the magistrate of Xunyang. When Su saw him, he said: \"Your talent and strategy are no longer the same as the Wuxia A Meng in the past (because Lu Meng has learned a lot of knowledge).\" Then he bowed to Meng's mother and left as friends. Later, Lu Meng also replaced Lu Su in command of the army. Lu Meng resigned due to illness in Lukou. Sun Quan asked, \"Who can replace you?\" Meng said, \"Lu Xun is thoughtful and capable of taking on important tasks. Judging from his planning and consideration, he will eventually be able to take on important tasks and will not make such mistakes again.\" Xun then replaced Meng.

Without learning, one cannot broaden one's talent; without ambition, one cannot complete learning. If one is licentious, one cannot be diligent; if one is reckless, one cannot control one's nature.

To learn true knowledge, you must study and explore in peace. People's talents are accumulated through continuous learning; if you don't study hard, you can't increase and develop your talents; if you don't have an unswerving will, you can't succeed in your studies. Indulgence and negativity cannot encourage the mind and cheer up the spirit; adventurous rashness and impatience cannot cultivate the temperament and make the moral integrity noble. If the years and years are wasted, and the volunteer time is wasted, they will eventually age day by day like dead branches and fallen leaves.

        "output": "This is related to chemistry. It turns out that there is a bright red pigment in the shells of cooked shrimps and crabs. If the red shells of shrimps and crabs are immersed in a chemical called acetone, this pigment will dye the acetone into a beautiful orange-red color, and the shell will fade and become lighter. Later, someone separated this pigment from lobster eggs and named it arttaxin.\n\nAnimals that contain arttaxin are not just shrimps and crabs, many crustaceans also use arttaxin to dress themselves up. Some small shellfish mainly contain encapsulant, and some crabs contain erythrin. These pigments, including arttaxin, have a similar structure to carotene, and they are widely distributed in nature in large quantities. The chemical name is ketocarotene, which is the main component of the pigment contained in animals such as \"shrimp soldiers and crabs\".\n\nThe body color of living crustaceans varies due to different species and different environments, but no matter what the body color of living \"shrimp soldiers and crabs\" is, as long as it is soaked in formaldehyde or heated, it will turn red. This is because the pigment protein in the organism denatures when heated, and the pigment originally combined with the protein \"escaped\" and revealed the red color.\n\nIn addition, the shell of dead shrimps and crabs will also turn red due to the denaturation of protein in the body and the escape of pigment.",

In Singapore and Malaysia, boiled chicken is often sold with chicken oil rice as \"Hainanese chicken rice\", which is a very popular street snack.\n\nThe key to boiled chicken is the selection of ingredients and the control of the heat.

If China's traffic rules develop along this line of thought, Shanghai's rickshaw drivers will become Ford drivers and should gallop on the left side of the Huangpu River Bund Highway.\n\n　　However, after 1945, the few Hummers and Ford cars in China all galloped on the right side of the road. Right-hand driving, this is how the Americans drove on the intercontinental highway in the Great Plains of the Central Plains. Why should we learn from the United States?\n\nThe story goes back to the Anti-Japanese War. During that war, the Chongqing government, which moved to the rear, received assistance from many American soldiers. The American transport team drove in Chongqing and went to the right, while the local Chinese mansion masters went to the left. \"Bang bang\", traffic accidents occurred frequently.

Please speak your mind.\" The ministers all said, \"Your Majesty's merits are like heaven and earth, and all things cannot be named.\" The emperor said, \"No. The reason why I can achieve this is only due to five things. Since ancient times, emperors often hate those who are better than themselves. I see the good in others as if I have it myself. People's behavior and ability cannot be perfect at the same time. I always abandon their shortcomings and take their strengths. The ruler often promotes the virtuous and wants to put them in his care. , and when I dismiss the unworthy, I want to push them into the abyss. When I see a virtuous person, I respect him, and when I see an unworthy person, I pity him, and the virtuous and the unworthy are each in their proper place. Most rulers hate the upright, and punish them secretly or openly, without a single generation without this. Since I ascended the throne, upright people have been shoulder to shoulder in the court, and I have never dismissed or blamed a single one. Since ancient times, people have valued the Chinese and despised the barbarians and the Di people. I alone love them all equally, so their tribes all rely on me like their parents. These five are the reasons why I have achieved what I have today. ” He turned to Chu Suiliang and said, “You have been a historian. Is what I said true?” He replied, “Your Majesty’s great virtues are beyond description, and you only give yourself these five, which is probably a humble intention.”",

My talent is not greater than that of the ancient emperors, but my achievements are greater than theirs. I don't know why. Please speak frankly.\" The ministers all said: \"Your Majesty's merits are as vast as the heaven and earth, and there is nothing to say about other things.\" Emperor Taizong of Tang said: \"You can't say that. The reason why I have such merits is that I have achieved five things: First, since ancient times, emperors have been jealous of those who are better than themselves. When I see the advantages of others, I treat them as my own advantages, as if they were my own advantages. Second, everyone's behavioral ability cannot be perfect, so I abandon their shortcomings and take their strengths. Third, most monarchs, when they see good people, want to hold them in their arms; when they see bad people, want to push them into the abyss. But I respect talented people when I see them; when I see people who perform poorly, I educate them from the perspective of love. So that both the virtuous and the unvirtuous can be in their proper place. Fourth, most monarchs do not like people to criticize them in person, and secretly harm or openly attack those who speak out. There is no dynasty that is not like this. Since I took the throne, there have been many people who speak out, and no one has been dismissed because of this. Fifth, the tradition regards the Han people as noble and discriminates against ethnic minorities, but I am the only one who treats them equally and loves them, so ethnic minorities rely on me like they rely on their parents.

He then wrote four lines of poetry and signed them with his own name. His poems were about supporting his parents and raising his family. They were circulated in the whole village. He could write poems on the spot by pointing at objects, and his writing and logic were both impressive. The people in the town were surprised by this and gradually invited his father to visit him. Sometimes he gave him money. His father was pleased with this and took Zhongyong around to visit the people in the town every day, but did not let him study. I have heard of him for a long time. In the Mingdao period, I returned home from my ancestors and saw him at my uncle's house. He was twelve or thirteen years old.

However, there are also many people who are deeply trapped in it and cannot extricate themselves. In the end, they lose everything and owe huge high-interest loans. What's worse, some end up with their wives and children separated and their families broken up. Then we can't help but ask, why do we always lose when playing \"slot machines\"? Next, I will deeply analyze this problem through mathematics and human nature.\n\nIn theory, the machine program is designed, and the probability of winning and losing should be similar, but why do we always lose? I will use the more common odds of 6,6,8,8,8,8,12,12 as an example to explain. First, the odds are set fairly. We can easily verify that 1/6+1/6+1/8+1/8+1/8+1/8+1/12+1/12=1. Secondly, the program is also pre-set, that is, for a certain game, you bet 10 points and 1000 points. So, where is the problem?\n\nFirst: We lost in common sense judgment. Although the program is designed, it is designed by someone after all, not randomly generated. We often encounter this kind of program, such as 6 times the rabbit, 4 or 5 times in a row, what is the concept? The probability of getting a rabbit is 1/6, and the theoretical probability of getting 5 consecutive draws is 1/7776. On average, one draw takes one minute, and there are 60 draws per hour in 24 hours a day. In other words, in theory, this situation will only occur once every 5.4 days on average, but in reality, we often encounter it 3 or 4 times a day. This is obviously unreasonable, and the reason lies in the human factors.\n\nFor example, if I bet on 12 times Eagle now, theoretically, it should come out once every 12 draws on average, but in reality, it is entirely possible that it will not come out for 32 consecutive draws (about half an hour). If I catch up with the extra 20 draws, I may lose all my capital, and naturally I will not be able to make up for it. Let's calculate again, what is the theoretical probability of not getting an eagle in 32 consecutive games? The probability of not getting an eagle in one game is 1-1/12=11/12, and the probability of not getting an eagle in 30 games is (11/12)^32, which is approximately equal to 6%. In mathematics, we call events with a probability less than 5% a small probability event, which means that it can be assumed that the event will not happen. His probability is already quite close, and in fact, this situation often happens.\n\nSecond: We lose because of our greed. Many people have this experience. When they first start playing, they encounter a good program and win quickly, but they are unwilling to leave after winning, and they still think that they have not won enough. So I continued to fight until I encountered the above program. I still didn't believe it and had to chase it. In the end, I lost everything with my capital and interest. Every time I lost, I told myself that I would only win as much as I could next time. A little bit of money can make a lot. This is indeed the truth, but how many people can really do it? If you bring 10,000 and win 1,000, it is still relatively easy. If you stick to it, your monthly income can still reach 30,000. But in fact, if you bring 10,000 and want to win 10,000, excessive greed will eventually lead to you losing everything.\n\nSo here I advise everyone to cherish life and stay away from electronic heroin. It's not too late to turn back now!",

When the enemy plane flew into our position, the infrared telescope had already received a large amount of infrared light radiated by its heat-generating part, the engine.

Although scientists still have disputes about where the force that pushes the earth's crust to move comes from, and there are many speculations about what the fundamental cause of earthquakes is, there is no doubt that the direct cause of earthquakes is the cracks in the rocks there. The vast majority of earthquakes occur when new fractures occur in the underground rocks, or when existing fractures move again. Many strong earthquakes occur in places where fractures exist underground. When the underground rock is close to breaking due to the force, the gravitational force of the sun and the moon, the change of the pressure of the atmosphere or water (reservoir) on the ground can promote the occurrence of rupture, all of which may trigger earthquakes.\n\nIn addition, earthquakes are often the companion of volcanic eruptions. There are many volcanoes on the earth. Every time a volcano erupts, a large amount of hot magma erupts from the ground, the volume expands rapidly, and impacts the earth's crust, so it will inevitably cause earthquakes.",

So it is not actually the wolf's eyes that emit green light. This starts with the role of the pupil, which is located in front of the lens and controls the intensity of light entering the lens. Its size changes with the intensity of light from the outside world. At night, the cat's pupil becomes larger, trying to receive more faint light, but because of the convergence of the lens and ciliary body, which is a convex lens, the light converges in a small range. It is precisely because the pupil is larger and the photoreceptor cells of people in the dark are columnar cells, with enhanced sensitivity, that it is seen as bright! There are many special crystal points at the bottom of the wolf's eyes. These crystal points have a strong ability to reflect light, which can gather the weak and scattered light around, aggregate it into a beam, and reflect it out in a concentrated way, as if the wolf's eyes are glowing.",

Climate warming has led to the melting of glaciers and the degradation of polar permafrost, which has posed a threat to polar ecosystems and animal species. At the same time, climate change has also affected the ecological balance of forests and wetlands, leading to species migration, ecosystem changes and reduced biodiversity. Climate change also has an impact on water supply and agriculture, and may cause problems such as droughts, floods and ecological imbalances. Therefore, Canada needs to work hard to cope with climate change and protect and restore the health of the ecosystem.",

        "instruction": "Why do tsunamis occur?",
        "output": "The source of tsunamis is also earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, usually earthquakes, but they occur on the seabed. When an earthquake or volcanic eruption occurs on the seabed, the huge energy will cause the sea water to rise and fall violently, thus forming strong waves and pushing forward. This kind of wave is powerful far away from the coast, and it actually has no effect at all. Even ships sailing on the sea surface only feel slight fluctuations. However, once the tsunami enters the continental shelf, it can bring devastating disasters to the coastal areas.\n\nIn English, the word tsunami is called tsunami. In fact, this is a Japanese word, and the Chinese character is \"津波\", which means waves at the port in Japanese, which fully shows that Japan is a country that is often hit by tsunamis.\n\nAlthough volcanic eruptions and other coastal landslides can also cause tsunamis, they are generally caused by submarine earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.5 or above and a focal point within 50 kilometers of the seafloor. After a strong earthquake, a circle of shock waves will appear on the sea surface. As the shock waves continue to expand, the circle will also continue to expand, just like the effect of throwing a stone into the water. Because the wavelength of a tsunami is greater than the maximum depth of the ocean, this shock wave can propagate to far away places.\n\nThe propagation speed of a tsunami is proportional to the depth of the water it moves. In the Pacific Ocean, this speed is generally between 200 and 300 kilometers per hour and more than 1,000 kilometers per hour. When a tsunami enters the coastal area, the depth of the sea suddenly becomes shallow, resulting in a sharp increase in wave height, and we can see a wall of water as high as 20 to 30 meters. When the wall of water comes down like a blanket, not to mention small lives, even houses and buildings will be swallowed up in an instant. Therefore, the disasters brought by tsunamis are often destructive. Many places hit by tsunamis usually have a lot of missing people, and most of them were actually swept away at that moment.\n\nBefore the tsunami comes, there is a rather strange phenomenon, that is, the tide will retreat all of a sudden, retreat to a place far away from the beach, and it will take some time for the sea water to rise again. What is the reason for this? It turns out that this sudden drop in the sea level is because the trough of the tsunami wave reaches this place. The so-called trough is the lowest part of the wave. When the trough arrives, the sea level must drop. At the same time, because the tsunami wave is different from ordinary waves, its wavelength is quite large. Therefore, after the trough lands, it takes a long time for the crest to arrive, and the water wall will only rush up at that time.\n\n　　With such knowledge, people can completely escape danger before the tsunami arrives. During the tsunami attack in Indonesia, some people who lingered on the beach at that time saw the sudden drop in the tide and realized the possible danger and evacuated in time, thus saving their lives.\n\nJust like earthquakes, people still have no control over tsunamis. They can only strengthen publicity and prevention in areas where tsunamis occur frequently to minimize unnecessary loss of life and property.",

The people called them the \"three evils\", and Zhou Chu was the most powerful among the three evils. So someone asked Zhou Chu: Since you are so capable, why don't you kill the tiger and the dragon to prove your strength? In fact, they hoped that the three evils would fight each other and only one would be left. After hearing this, Zhou Chu immediately went up the mountain to kill the tiger, and then jumped into the water to fight the dragon. The dragon floated or sank in the water and drifted dozens of miles away. After three days and three nights, the people thought that the dragon and Zhou Chu were dead together, and they came out to celebrate. As a result, Zhou Chu killed the dragon and climbed up from the shore with its head. Hearing that the villagers thought he was dead and expressed their congratulations, he realized that in fact everyone also regarded him as a great scourge, and he couldn't help but burst into tears and felt repentant. So he went to Wujun to find Lu Ji and Lu Yun, two famous scholars in Dongwu at that time. Lu Ji was not there, and only Lu Yun was there. Zhou Chu told him the whole situation and said, \"I want to correct my mistakes, but I have wasted my time and I am afraid that I will not achieve anything in the end.\" Lu Yun said, \"The ancients cherished morality and believed that 'even if I understand the truth in the morning, I will be willing to die in the evening.'

Since the positioning of the points on the surface of the disk is usually inaccurate, formats such as sectors are also used to help find the location of the record.

        "output": "The human body usually has some different reactions when it is hungry, such as the simplest \"feeling\" hungry, or \"stomach growling with hunger\", or even \"dizzy with hunger\".\n\n　　Jorg Hassler, a scientist from the Potsdam Institute of Nutrition, believes that the \"growing\" is undoubtedly the most clear signal that you need to eat.\n\n　　According to the German News Agency, Hassler's research found that when people say that their stomachs are empty and hungry, there is actually air and water in the stomach. In this case, the \"pulling\" movement of the stomach muscles will make the stomach form a \"soft tube\"-like state. \"The air and water are squeezed in this hose, so they naturally make a gurgling sound,\" Hasler explained.\n\nScientists believe that the whole process is actually just a natural reaction in the human body. In addition, this reaction will be stimulated or strengthened by other reactions of the human body under certain conditions. For example, when some delicious food falls into your sight, causing your mouth to start to secrete saliva and your stomach to start to secrete gastric acid and other substances that help digestion, you will feel hungry, and your stomach will often start to \"gurgle\" in due time.",

People who use their brains frequently have their cerebral blood vessels often in a state of stretching, and their brain nerve cells will be well maintained, making the brain more developed and avoiding premature aging of the brain. On the contrary, people who are lazy to use their brains are prone to premature aging because their brains are less stimulated by information.\n\nScientists observed a certain number of people aged 20 to 70 and found that those who engaged in mental work for a long time could still maintain sharp thinking ability at the age of 60; while among those lazy people who did nothing all day and lived a life of mediocrity, the proportion of those with premature brain aging was much higher than the former.",

With the end of the breeding season, this phenomenon of spreading the tail will gradually disappear. In addition, female peacocks and peacocks also spread their tails to defend or warn against enemies. This is just like when chickens are attacked by eagles, the hen will raise her feathers and flap her wings in an attempt to protect the chicks.\n\nAs for the peacocks spreading their tails in front of the tourists in gorgeous clothes, it is not to compete with them for beauty, but the tourists' loud noises stimulate the peacocks and make them alert.

Minehunters can only destroy mines one by one, so they have limitations in use, but minehunters reduce the blindness of minesweeping operations and change the passive situation in anti-mine warfare. Minehunters need to make a careful search plan before hunting mines.\n\nThe operating speed should be able to ensure that the sonar has a good detection effect. After finding the underwater target, the identification sonar is used to identify it. After confirming that it is a mine, the mine destroyer is released and the explosive device is dropped to blow up the mine. Not counting the search process, it usually takes about half an hour from releasing the mine destroyer, destroying the mine to recovering the mine. When conducting formation mine hunting, a single horizontal team is usually used, and the search range of each ship's sonar should overlap to a certain extent to ensure that no mines are missed.",

This is completely unscientific. So, what is the function of the gallbladder?\n\nFirst, it can store bile, which is stored in the gallbladder and discharged from the gallbladder when digestion is needed. In addition, the gallbladder can concentrate bile. Most of the water and electrolytes in the yellow alkaline liver bile are absorbed by the gallbladder mucosa and returned to the blood, leaving the effective ingredients in the bile stored in the gallbladder. Moreover, the gallbladder can secrete mucus to protect the gallbladder mucosa from being eroded and dissolved by concentrated bile. Most importantly, 3 to 5 hours after eating, food passes through the duodenum and stimulates the duodenal mucosa, producing a hormone called cholecystokinin, which can shrink the gallbladder and immediately discharge the bile in the gallbladder into the duodenum to help digestion and absorption of fat.\n\nIt can be seen that the most important task of the gallbladder is to help digestion, which has nothing to do with the size of the gallbladder.",

Aluminum combines the advantages of plastic and metal, and is light and textured.\n\nGlass. Glass photo frames are very beautiful. A photo wall with a set of glass photo frames at home also expresses the owner's taste, but the only disadvantage is that it is fragile.\n\nCrystal.

It has never happened since ancient times that the public sentiment does not follow the same desires and dislikes as the public. The root of the chaos lies in the people's hearts. What's more, when there is a change of circumstances and a time of danger and doubt, people will be rooted in where they are, and will be inclined to where they are. How can Your Majesty not carefully examine the public sentiment, share their desires and dislikes, and make millions of people follow the same interests to stabilize the country? This is truly the most urgent task of the day.\"",
        "output": "Emperor Dezong asked Lu Zhi about the most urgent matter of the day. Lu Zhi believed that the reason for the chaos in the past was the lack of communication between the upper and lower classes. He advised Emperor Dezong to get in touch with the people and listen to their advice. So he submitted a memorial, which roughly said: \"I think the most urgent matter of the day is to carefully examine the will of the people. If it is something that the people like very much, then Your Majesty should implement it first; if it is something that the people hate very much, then Your Majesty should get rid of it first. Your Majesty's likes and dislikes are the same as those of the people in the world, but the people in the world are unwilling to turn to Your Majesty. This has never happened from ancient times to the present. Generally speaking, the root of order and chaos is closely related to the people's hearts. Moreover, when the changes happen and the people's hearts are shaken, it is a dangerous and doubtful moment when the people's hearts turn to it, everything will be prosperous; when the people's hearts are separated, everything will be in danger. How can Your Majesty not examine the will of the people, share their likes and dislikes, make the people yearn for it, and stabilize the country! This is the most urgent thing at the moment.\"",

Building the river bank wider at the bottom and narrower at the top is to adapt to the changes in the river water pressure and save materials. Since the gravity of the river bank is vertical, it will produce an oblique force with the horizontal thrust of the waves. If the total force exceeds the bottom of the river bank, the river bank will fall. If the river bank is built wider at the bottom and narrower at the top, the combined force will not exceed the bottom of the river bank, so the river bank can stand more stably. In addition, building the bank into a slope can also prevent the soil from collapsing. The volume is wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, so that the weight per unit area of ​​the foundation at the bottom of the river bank is relatively small, which reduces the burden on the bottom of the river bank and makes the river bank stand more firmly.",

        "output": "First of all, this is of course a normal phenomenon. Water has the effect of relaxing and softening tissues.\n\nResearch shows that the skin on the palms and soles of the feet is the thickest, which has a protective effect on the hands and feet, which is why wrinkles are most likely to form. Our skin is actually covered with a thin layer of oil to prevent the skin from absorbing water directly from the outside. However, when we soak in warm or hot water for about half an hour, this layer of oil will be removed by the warm water, so the skin begins to absorb water. The surface of our skin is a layer of \"epidermis\", and below the epidermis is the \"dermis\"; the epidermis and the dermis are not completely \"sticked\" together. The epidermis is only tightly \"bound\" to the dermis by connective tissue in some areas, but not in some areas; therefore, when the epidermis absorbs water and \"swells\", the \"bound\" areas are confined and concave; from the outside, the surface of the skin has concave and convex, like wrinkles.\n\nThe epidermis is composed of tough dead cells. Under a microscope, some of these cells look like paving stones. Generally speaking, the epidermis is very thin, only about 0.01 mm, but the thickness of the epidermis on the palms and soles of the feet reaches or exceeds 0.5 mm, so the wrinkles are particularly obvious. In theory, swimming or bathing can also cause wrinkles on the skin of the chest and abdomen, but since these parts have almost no expandable stratum corneum, only some tiny wrinkles appear.\n\nIn the past, some women specialized in washing clothes for others. Their hands were soaked in water for a long time, and their fingers were often wrinkled, which became an occupational \"disease\" (or should it be a characteristic). In ancient times, laundry women were called \"Piao Mu\", so this finger phenomenon was also called \"Piao Mu skin\".",

Without learning, one cannot broaden his talent; without ambition, one cannot complete learning. If one is licentious, one cannot be diligent; if one is reckless, one cannot control his nature.

They make themselves perfect through meditation and reflection, and cultivate their noble character through frugality and thrift. If you don't have a clear mind and few desires, you can't make your ambition clear and firm. If you are not calm and quiet, you can't realize your lofty ideals and study hard for a long time. To learn true knowledge, you must study and explore in peace. People's talents are accumulated through continuous learning; if you don't study hard, you can't increase and develop your talents; if you don't have an unswerving will, you can't succeed in your studies. Indulgence and negativity cannot encourage the mind and cheer up the spirit; adventurous rashness and impatience cannot cultivate the temperament and make the moral integrity noble. If the years and years are wasted, and the volunteer time is wasted, they will eventually age day by day like dead branches and fallen leaves. Such people will not be used by society and benefit society. They can only be sadly trapped in their own poor homes, and it will be too late to regret then.",

The people of Yixing called them the three evils, and Chu was the worst. Some said that Chu killed the tiger and the dragon, but he actually hoped that only one of the three evils would be left. Chu immediately stabbed the tiger to death, and then went into the water to kill the dragon. The dragon floated or sank, and traveled dozens of miles with Chu. After three days and three nights, the villagers all thought it was dead, and they celebrated. Finally, he killed the dragon and got out. When he heard the villagers celebrating, he realized that he was troubled by human nature and wanted to change himself. So he went from Wu to look for the two Lu. Pingyuan was not there, and he met Qinghe, who told him the truth and said that he wanted to change himself but had wasted years and would never achieve anything. Qinghe said: \"The ancients valued hearing in the morning and dying in the evening, and you still have a good future.

In addition, there was a dragon in the water of Yixing and a white-browed tiger on the mountain. They were a scourge to the people. The people called them the \"three evils\", and Zhou Chu was the most powerful among the three evils. So someone asked Zhou Chu: Since you are so capable, why don't you kill the tiger and the dragon to prove your strength? In fact, they hoped that the three evils would fight each other and only one would be left. After hearing this, Zhou Chu immediately went up the mountain to kill the tiger, and then jumped into the water to fight the dragon. The dragon floated or sank in the water and drifted dozens of miles away. After three days and three nights, the people thought that the dragon and Zhou Chu were dead together, and they came out to celebrate. As a result, Zhou Chu killed the dragon and climbed up from the shore with its head. Hearing that the villagers thought he was dead and expressed their congratulations, he realized that in fact everyone also regarded him as a great scourge, and he couldn't help but burst into tears and felt repentant. So he went to Wujun to find Lu Ji and Lu Yun, two famous scholars in Dongwu at that time. Lu Ji was not there, and only Lu Yun was there. Zhou Chu told him the whole situation and said, \"I want to correct my mistakes, but I have wasted my time and I am afraid that I will not achieve anything in the end.\" Lu Yun said, \"The ancients cherished morality and believed that \"even if I understand the truth in the morning, I will be willing to die in the evening.\" Besides, your future is still promising. Besides, people are afraid of not being able to set their ambitions. As long as you can set your ambitions and work hard to achieve them, why worry about not spreading your good reputation?\" After hearing this, Zhou Chu decided to reform himself and eventually became a loyal minister and filial son.",

        "output": "The current ratio is a measure of the ratio between a company's current assets (such as cash, inventory, and accounts receivable) and current liabilities (such as short-term loans and accounts payable). Generally, a higher current ratio means that the company is more able to meet its short-term liabilities, and therefore has stronger liquidity and solvency. The current ratio is usually calculated as follows:\n\nCurrent ratio = (Current assets) / (Current liabilities)\n\nDifferent companies may have different current ratio targets, so the current ratio itself does not mean good or bad. However, generally, the higher the current ratio, the better, because it means that the company is more able to meet its short-term liabilities. However, a current ratio that is too high may mean that the company is not fully utilizing its assets, and therefore may miss investment opportunities.",

Therefore, when you walk in the darkness, the light becomes the thing that stays in your field of vision the longest, so you will feel that the moon is always following you.\n\nIn fact, the moon does not follow people. We have this feeling for two reasons: First, because the moon is a huge celestial body, far away from us, and there is nothing around us that can block its brilliance. It is not that it follows us, but that we cannot walk out of its range no matter where we go. Second, it is an illusion caused by relative motion. For example, when sitting on a moving train, you will feel that the trees and fields on both sides are moving, but in fact, it is only the train that is moving. The same is true when the moon follows people. It is not the moon that is walking, but we are walking. It is just that the distance we walk is too small compared to the earth and the moon. At the same time, the distance between the moon and the earth is 380,000 kilometers.\n\nWhen people look up at the bright moon in the sky, it is in a certain position. When people walk, they move a distance, but this distance is completely negligible for the earth, and the change in viewing angle for the moon is also completely negligible. This means that walking will hardly change the relative position between you and the moon. It looks like the moon is following people.",

When determining custody, the court will comprehensively consider the child's current living conditions, the work income and morality of both spouses, and whether the child has been raised by one parent. In my country, according to the legal provisions on marriage and family and relevant judicial interpretations, the establishment of direct custody of minors mainly has the following principles:\n1. The principle is to benefit the physical and mental health of children and protect the legitimate rights and interests of children;\n2. Children in the breastfeeding period should be raised by the breastfeeding mother;\n3. For children after the breastfeeding period, the negotiation between the two parties is given priority. When no agreement can be reached, the judgment is supplemented by the rights and interests of the children and the specific circumstances of both parties;\n4. For minors over ten years old who live with their father or mother, if there is a dispute, the opinions of the minors should be appropriately considered. The party that does not raise the child should pay the maintenance fee, which is generally 20-30% of the income of the party that does not raise the child. Maintenance fees include living expenses, education expenses, medical expenses, etc. The specific maintenance fee should be determined based on the local living standards and the actual living expenses of the child.\nArticle 1084 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China: The relationship between parents and children does not disappear due to the divorce of parents. After divorce, children are still the children of both parents regardless of whether they are directly raised by the father or the mother.\nAfter divorce, parents still have the right and obligation to raise, educate and protect their children.\nAfter divorce, children under the age of two shall be raised directly by the mother in principle. For children over the age of two, if the parents cannot reach an agreement on the issue of raising, the People's Court shall make a judgment based on the specific circumstances of both parties and in accordance with the principle of what is most beneficial to the minor children. If the child is over the age of eight, his or her true wishes shall be respected.",

When there were disputes among the people, Chen Shi made fair judgments and told the people the right and wrong of the truth. The people did not complain after returning home. Everyone sighed and said, \"It is better to be punished than to be criticized by Chen Shi.\" At that time, the harvest was bad and the people had no harvest. A thief broke into Chen Shi's house at night and hid on the beam. Chen Shi secretly discovered it, so he got up and tidied his clothes, asked his children and grandchildren to gather around, and sternly admonished them, saying, \"People must encourage themselves. Unkind people are not necessarily bad by nature. (Bad) habits are often formed by (not paying attention to) character cultivation, so they reach such a point. The gentleman on the beam is such a person!\" The thief was shocked and jumped from the beam to the ground, knelt on the ground, and sincerely confessed his guilt. Chen Shi slowly told him: \"Looking at your appearance, you don't look like a bad person. You should restrain yourself and return to the right path. However, your behavior is probably caused by poverty.\" In the end, he gave the thief two pieces of silk. From then on, there was no more theft in the county.",

It is located in front of the lens and controls the intensity of light entering the lens. Its size changes with the intensity of light from the outside world. At night, the cat's pupil becomes larger and tries to receive more faint light. However, because of the convergence of the lens and ciliary body, it is a convex lens, and the light converges in a small range. It is precisely because the pupil is larger and the photoreceptor cells of people in the dark are columnar cells, with enhanced sensitivity, that it is seen as bright! There are many special crystal points at the bottom of the wolf's eyes.\n\nThese crystal points have a strong ability to reflect light. They can gather the weak and scattered light around them, gather them into beams, and reflect them out in a concentrated way, as if the wolf's eyes are glowing.",

Women appear to be more susceptible to the disease, as are certain ethnic groups, such as South Asians, Pacific Islanders, Latinos, and Native Americans. This may be due to the increased susceptibility of certain ethnic groups to Western lifestyles. Traditionally considered a disease of adults, children are increasingly being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes as obesity rates rise. Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed as often in adolescents in the United States as type 1 diabetes. The number of people with diabetes was estimated at 30 million in 1985, increasing to 135 million in 1995 and 217 million in 2005. This increase is primarily attributed to the aging of the global population, declining physical activity, and rising obesity rates. As of 2000, The five countries with the highest number of diabetes patients are India with 3.17 million, China with 20.8 million, the United States with 17.7 million, Indonesia with 8.4 million, and Japan with 680,000.

He wrote four lines of poetry and signed it himself. His poems were about supporting his parents and raising a clan, and were circulated throughout the village. He could write poems by pointing at objects, and his writing and logic were both impressive. The people of the town were surprised by this, and gradually invited his father to visit him, or gave him money. His father was pleased with this, so he took Zhongyong around to visit the people of the town every day, but did not let him study. I have heard of him for a long time. In the Mingdao period, I returned home from my ancestors and saw him at my uncle's house. He was twelve or thirteen years old. I asked him to write a poem, but it was not as good as before.

From then on, he was asked to write poems on designated items, and he could write them immediately. The literary talent and truth of the poems were worth seeing.

        "output": "Many parents of children with facial paralysis have said that their children have always been healthy, so how come they suddenly have facial paralysis? In fact, the triggering factors of facial paralysis are often invisible, not the tangible factors such as trauma that we understand. Viral infection is the most common cause of facial paralysis in children, followed by cold, which means that facial paralysis often occurs without signs.\n\nFirst, common causes\nThere are many reasons for children's facial paralysis, including viral infection and cold, among which viral infection is the main triggering factor. Most children with facial paralysis have a history of viral infection such as colds and pharyngitis before the onset of the disease. Some children are caused by inflammation of the periosteum of the mastoid foramen behind the ear, which compresses the facial nerves and causes functional disorders caused by insufficient blood supply. Therefore, parents and friends should pay attention to keeping their children warm.\n\nSecond, improper treatment\n\nIn fact, improper treatment is also the cause of facial paralysis in children. This reason is not the inducing reason, but the contributing reason. After many children have facial paralysis, their parents do not discover it in time, or they are superstitious about some folk remedies and do not seek timely diagnosis and treatment, which delays the best treatment time and leaves permanent regrets for their children. Early treatment of facial paralysis is relatively simple, so parents should discover and treat their children's facial paralysis early.\n\nThird, standardized treatment\n\nThe treatment of facial paralysis often requires a relatively long process. Generally, it takes one or two months of treatment for the child to gradually recover. During treatment, parents should take their children to regular hospitals for standardized treatment. Under the guidance of a neurologist, they can use drugs and injections, and can also receive acupuncture and moxibustion therapy. Whether the diagnosis is timely is directly related to the prognosis of recovery, so parents should pay attention to it.\n\nAfter understanding the causes of facial paralysis in children, parents also need to understand the hazards of facial paralysis and related treatment methods. If facial paralysis is not treated correctly, it is easy to cause sequelae and affect the child's future life and work.",

When these small ice crystals collide with each other, the surface of the ice crystals will heat up and melt a little, and they will stick to each other and freeze again. This is repeated many times, and the ice crystals will grow larger. In addition, there is water vapor in the cloud, so the ice crystals can continue to grow by condensation. However, ice clouds are generally very high and not thick. There is not much water vapor there, condensation grows very slowly, and there are not many opportunities for collision with each other, so they cannot grow very large to form precipitation. Even if precipitation is caused, it is often evaporated on the way down and rarely falls to the ground.\n\n　　Mixed clouds are most conducive to the growth of cloud droplets. Mixed clouds are composed of small ice crystals and supercooled water droplets. When a mass of air has reached saturation for ice crystals, it has not yet reached saturation for water droplets. At this time, the water vapor in the cloud condenses on the surface of the ice crystal, while the supercooled water droplets evaporate, and the ice crystals \"absorb\" the water vapor from the supercooled water droplets. In this case, the ice crystals grow very fast. In addition, supercooled water is very unstable. Once it is touched, it will freeze. Therefore, in the mixed cloud, when the supercooled water droplets collide with the ice crystals, they will freeze and adhere to the surface of the ice crystals, causing them to grow rapidly. When the small ice crystals grow to a size that can overcome the resistance and buoyancy of the air, they fall to the ground, and this is a snowflake.",

It can be seen that there is a lot to learn about wings alone.\n\nThe complexity of the structure of bird wings is no less complex than the complexity of the birds themselves. If the feather structure of bird wings can cleverly apply the principles of aerodynamics, when they flap up and down or lift up and down, they can push the air and fly forward using the reaction principle; if the feather structure is reasonable, it can effectively reduce the air resistance encountered during flight, and some can also play the role of eliminating vibration and noise. There are great differences in the wings of various bird species, so the difference in wings alone makes for many excellent and average pilots.",

When its front edge comes into contact with the warm and humid air in the south, because the cold air is heavier than the warm air, it will lift the warm and humid air to the high altitude, causing the water vapor in the warm air to quickly condense into ice crystals, which gradually grow and fall down as snowflakes.\n\nBefore the arrival of a cold wave, the warm and humid air flow in the south is generally very active, so the weather will warm up a little. And the condensation of water vapor into snowflakes also releases a certain amount of heat, which makes the weather before and during the snow not very cold.\n\nAfter the center of the cold wave passes, the clouds disappear and the snow stops, and the weather immediately becomes clear. Because the sky loses the barrier of clouds, the ground begins to release a large amount of heat outward, and the temperature drops very low at this time. In addition, snow melts under sunlight, absorbing a large amount of heat. According to experiments, 1 gram of 0℃ ice melts into 0℃ water, absorbing 334.4 joules (80 calories) of heat. Therefore, when a large piece of snow melts, the amount of heat absorbed is considerable, so people feel that the weather is colder.",

Due to the high speed of pecking, the impact on the woodpecker's head when pecking wood is equivalent to 1,000 times the gravity it is subjected to, which is equivalent to 250 times the pressure an astronaut experiences when taking off on a rocket. The impact that a woodpecker is subjected to when pecking wood is so great, so why doesn't it suffer a concussion?\n\nIt turns out that the woodpecker's skull is very strong. There is a layer of spongy bones around its brain, which contains fluid and can buffer and absorb external forces. Its brain case is also covered with shock-absorbing muscles, which can keep the tip of its beak and head in a straight line at all times, so that its head moves strictly in a straight line when pecking. If the woodpecker's head tilts slightly while pecking, the twisting motion plus the impact of pecking will damage its brain. Because the tip of the woodpecker's beak and head are always in a straight line, even though it pecks at the wood more than 1.02 million times a day, it can withstand strong vibrations all year round.",

All valleys on the south side flow into the Wen River, and all valleys on the south side flow into the Ji River. The ancient Great Wall is where the mountains divide north and south. Riguan Peak is fifteen miles south of the Great Wall.\n\nIn December of the thirty-ninth year of Qianlong's reign, I left the capital in the snow and wind, passed through Qihe and Changqing, crossed the northwest valley of Mount Tai, crossed the Great Wall, and arrived at Tai'an. On the 25th day of that month, I climbed from the south foot with the prefect Zhu Xiaochun's son Ying. Forty-five miles, the road was all paved with stone steps, with more than seven thousand steps. There are three valleys on the south side of Mount Tai. The middle valley goes around the city of Tai'an, which is what Li Daoyuan called the ring water. I started to enter through it, and after walking less than half of the way, I crossed the middle ridge and followed the west valley again, and finally reached the top. In ancient times, when climbing mountains, people entered through the east valley, and there was a Tianmen on the road. The east valley was called Tianmen Creek in ancient times, which I have never been to. The cliffs blocking the way in the middle ridge and the top of the mountain we are passing now are called Tianmen Clouds by the world. The road is foggy and slippery, and the steps are almost impossible to climb. When we get to the top, the Cangshan Mountain is covered with snow, shining brightly in the south sky. The setting sun shines on the city walls, the Wenshui River and Culai are like a painting, and the fog in the middle of the mountain is like a belt.\n\n　　On the fifth drum of the Wushen night, I sat in the Sun Viewing Pavilion with Ziying, waiting for the sunrise. The strong wind blew the accumulated snow and hit our faces. The east of the pavilion was covered with clouds from the feet. I saw a few white clouds in the clouds, which looked like dozens of puddings. They were mountains. There was a line of clouds in the sky with different colors, and in a moment it became five colors. When the sun rose, it was red like cinnabar, and there was a red light shaking below it. Some people said that this was the East China Sea. Looking back at the peaks west of the Sun Viewing Pavilion, some were in the sun and some were not, and the colors were crimson and white, and they all looked hunched.\n\n　　To the west of the pavilion is the Dai Temple, and there is also the Bixia Yuanjun Temple. The emperor's palace is to the east of the Bixia Yuanjun Temple. The stone carvings on the way to Riguan have been there since the Tang Xianqing period; the ancient carvings have all been lost. Those that are remote and not on the road are not visited.\n\n　　The mountain has more stones and less soil. The stones are dark blue, mostly square, less round. There are few miscellaneous trees, but many pines, growing in the cracks of the rocks, all with flat tops. There is ice and snow, no waterfalls, no sounds of birds or animals. There are no trees within a few miles of Riguan, and the snow is knee-high.\n\n　　Recorded by Yao Nai of Tongcheng.",
        "output": "To the south of Mount Tai, the Wenshui River flows westward; to the north, the Jishui River flows eastward. The water in the southern valleys flows into the Wenshui River, and the water in the northern valleys flows into the Jishui River. At the boundary between the southern and northern valleys is the ancient Great Wall. The Riguan Peak is located fifteen miles south of the ancient Great Wall.\n\nIn December of the thirty-ninth year of the Qianlong reign, I set out from the capital in the snow and wind, passed through Qihe and Changqing counties, crossed the valley northwest of Mount Tai, crossed the wall of the Great Wall, and arrived at Tai'an. On the Dingwei day of this month, I went up the mountain from the south foot of the mountain with the prefect Zhu Xiaochun, whose courtesy name was Ziying. The 45-mile-long road was all stone steps, with more than 7,000 steps. There are three valleys to the south of Mount Tai. The water in the middle valley surrounds the city of Tai'an, which is what Li Daoyuan called the Huanshui in his book. I first entered the mountain along the middle valley, walked a short distance, crossed the middle ridge, and walked along the valley to the west, and reached the top of the mountain. In ancient times, when climbing Mount Tai, you went in along the valley on the east side. There was a gate on the road. This valley on the east side was called \"Tianmen Creek\" in ancient times. I have never been there. Now, the cliffs on the middle ridge and the top of the mountain that I passed by are like thresholds across the road. People call it the gate of heaven. The road was foggy and slippery, and the stone steps were almost impossible to climb. When I reached the top of the mountain, I saw the green mountains covered with white snow, and the light of the snow illuminated the sky in the south. Looking at the sunset shining on Tai'an City from afar, Wenshui River and Culai Mountain were like a beautiful landscape painting, and the clouds and mists that stayed on the hillside were like a dancing ribbon.\n\nThe day of Wushen was the end of the month. At five o'clock in the morning, Ziying and I sat in the Sun Viewing Pavilion, waiting for the sunrise. At this time, the snow blown up by the strong wind hit us in the face. To the east of the Sun Viewing Pavilion, from the bottom of the feet to the bottom, there was a cloud of mist, and dozens of white dice-like things could be vaguely seen in the clouds. That was the peak. The clouds on the horizon formed a line with strange colors, and then turned into colorful ones. The sun rose, red like cinnabar, and there was a red light shaking and swaying below to support it. Some people said that this was the East China Sea. Looking back at the peaks west of Riguan Peak, some were illuminated by the sun, some were not, some were red or white, with mixed colors, all of them looked like they were bending their backs and bowing to pay tribute.\n\n　　To the west of Riguan Pavilion is the Dai Temple and the Bixia Yuanjun Temple; the emperor's palace is to the east of the Bixia Yuanjun Temple. On this day, (also) watched the stone carvings on the road, all of which were from the Xianqing period of the Tang Dynasty. Those older stone tablets have been blurred or missing. Those stone carvings that are remote and not facing the road were not seen in time.\n\n　　There are many stones on the mountain and little soil. The rocks are all blue-black, mostly flat and square, and rarely round. There are few miscellaneous trees, mostly pine trees, which grow in the cracks of the stones and have flat treetops. It was a land of ice and snow, with no waterfalls, no sounds or traces of birds or animals. There were no trees within a few miles of Riguan Peak, and the snow was as thick as a person's knees.\n\nRecorded by Yao Nai of Tongcheng.",

        "output": "IAM and AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly transformative role in identity and access management, enabling organizations to take a more granular and adaptive approach to authentication and access management. AI is also essential for user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to identify suspicious activity. Indicators such as malicious logins, a large number of login attempts in a short period of time, unknown locations, unrecognized devices, and whether the user is on the company's virtual private network (VPN) can all indicate malicious activity. AI can flag these indicators for real-time or near-real-time investigation to stop hackers.\n\nIAM, Cloud, and IDaaS\n\nIAM from the Cloud: Identity as a Service (IDaaS) and Managed Identity Services.\nAn increasing number of vendors are offering identity and access management services delivered from the cloud. One approach is called identity as a service (IDaaS), which can be a standalone solution or a complement to an existing on-premises IAM system. With managed identity services, as with other managed security service solutions, the security provider will monitor and manage the enterprise IAM solution running in the cloud or on-premises.\n\nIAM for the Cloud.\nToday’s enterprises have applications and data on-premises, in legacy systems and private clouds, and in one or more public cloud environments. The challenge is to manage user access to resources as seamlessly as possible, regardless of where those resources reside. The ideal identity and access management system should support SSO and MFA across hybrid multi-cloud environments.\n\nIAM and BYOD\nIn today’s mobile world, employees want the freedom to work from anywhere using their own phones, tablets, laptops or wearables, and organizations are adopting BYOD (bring your own device) programs to enable it. IAM combined with a unified endpoint management platform can help organizations embrace mobility and securely adopt BYOD. \n\nIAM and IoT\nIt’s a well-known story. A hacker hacked into an aquarium smart thermometer, gained access to the company network and stole customer data. So did connected CCTV cameras. The lesson is that nearly any Internet of Things (IoT) device can be hacked, and without access management, the network is open to hackers. Today’s IAM solutions treat IoT devices as entities that need to be identified and authorized before network access.",

        "output": "In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of an encrypted electronic currency called e-money. Later, in 1995, he implemented an early form of this encrypted electronic payment through Digicash. Digicash requires user software to extract paper money from the bank and specify a specific encryption key before sending it to the recipient. This makes the digital currency untraceable by third parties.\n\nIn 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper titled \"How to Make a Mint: Cryptography for Anonymous Electronic Cash\" describing a cryptocurrency system. The paper was first published on the MIT mailing list and published in the American Law Review in late 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Wei Dai described \"b-money\", an anonymous distributed electronic cash system. Shortly afterwards, Nick Szabo described bit gold. Like Bitcoin and other subsequent cryptocurrencies, bit gold was described as an electronic currency system that required users to complete a proof-of-work function, the solution of which was cryptographically combined and published.\n\nIn January 2009, Bitcoin was created by the pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hashing function, in its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created in an attempt to form a decentralized DNS. In October 2011, Litecoin was launched, which used scrypt instead of SHA-256 as its hashing function. Peercoin was created in August 2012 and uses a mix of proof of work and proof of stake.\n\nCryptocurrencies have gone through several periods of growth and contraction, including multiple bubbles and market crashes, such as in 2011, 2013-2014-15, 2017-2018, and 2021-2023.\n\nOn August 6, 2014, the United Kingdom announced that its Treasury had commissioned a study into cryptocurrencies and what role, if any, they might play in the UK economy. The study was also supposed to report on whether regulation should be considered. Its final report was published in 2018, and a consultation on crypto assets and stablecoins was released in January 2021.\n\nIn June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, after the Legislative Assembly passed a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele by a vote of 62-22.\n\nIn August 2021, Cuba also issued Resolution No. 215, recognizing and regulating cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nIn September 2021, the Chinese government, the world's largest cryptocurrency market, declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal. This completed a crackdown on intermediaries and miners that were previously banned from operating in China.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, Ethereum, then the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, completed the upgrade of its consensus mechanism from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), a process known as \"merger\". According to Ethereum's founder, the upgrade could reduce Ethereum's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by 99.9%.\n\nOn November 11, 2022, cryptocurrency exchange FTX Trading Ltd., which also operates a crypto hedge fund and is valued at $18 billion, filed for bankruptcy. The financial impact of the collapse went beyond the FTX customer base, as reported by Reuters, while at a conference, financial industry executives said \"regulators must step in to protect cryptocurrency investors.\" Technical analyst Avivah Litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, saying \"everything needs to improve significantly in terms of user experience, control, security, and customer service.\"",

With the help of these \"good external helpers\", the space shuttle first rises to an altitude of tens of kilometers and drops two fuel-depleted booster rockets (they are recovered by parachutes and reused). When it rises to an altitude of more than 100 kilometers, it discards the huge external fuel tank. Only then can the space shuttle's own engine be enough to send it to an orbit hundreds of kilometers high.\n\n　　With so many \"cans and jars\" hanging on it, the space shuttle certainly cannot take off horizontally like an airplane, and the air resistance it encounters is far greater than that of a large airplane. Besides, rocket engines are impatient and can only work for a short time. Therefore, the space shuttle must rise vertically in the first one or two minutes and rush out of the dense lower atmosphere as quickly as possible. When it returns, it has already gotten rid of the cumbersome external hangings and can land like a glider.\n\n　　Using a reusable space shuttle to launch satellites is cheaper than using a traditional launch vehicle that is scrapped after one use. However, the space shuttle can only be launched from an expensive launch pad and needs to be reassembled after each flight, so it cannot be reused in the short term. Therefore, by the 21st century, it will be replaced by a more advanced aerospace plane.",

The people of Yixing called them the three evils, and Chu was the worst. Some said that Chu killed the tiger and the dragon, but he actually hoped that only one of the three evils would be left. Chu immediately stabbed the tiger to death, and then went into the water to kill the dragon. The dragon floated or sank, and traveled dozens of miles with Chu. After three days and three nights, the people in the village all thought it was dead, and they celebrated. Finally, he killed the dragon and got out. When he heard the people in the village celebrating, he realized that he was troubled by human nature and wanted to change himself. So he went from Wu to look for the two Lu. Pingyuan was not there, and he met Qinghe. He told them the truth and said that he wanted to change himself, but he had wasted years and would never achieve anything. Qinghe said: \"The ancients valued hearing in the morning and dying in the evening. Besides, your future is still good. Besides, people worry about not being able to establish their ambitions, so why worry about not being famous?\" Chu then changed his ways and became a loyal minister and filial son.",

In addition, there was a dragon in the water of Yixing and a white-browed tiger on the mountain. They were a scourge to the people. The people called them the \"three evils\", and Zhou Chu was the most powerful among the three evils. So someone asked Zhou Chu: Since you are so capable, why don't you kill the tiger and the dragon to prove your strength? In fact, they hoped that the three evils would fight each other and only one would be left. After hearing this, Zhou Chu immediately went up the mountain to kill the tiger, and then jumped into the water to fight the dragon. The dragon floated or sank in the water and drifted dozens of miles away. After three days and three nights, the people thought that the dragon and Zhou Chu were dead together, and they came out to celebrate. As a result, Zhou Chu killed the dragon and climbed up from the shore with its head. Hearing that the villagers thought he was dead and expressed their congratulations, he realized that in fact everyone also regarded him as a great scourge, and he couldn't help but burst into tears and felt repentant. So he went to Wujun to find Lu Ji and Lu Yun, two famous scholars in Dongwu at that time. Lu Ji was not there, and only Lu Yun was there. Zhou Chu told him the whole situation and said, \"I want to correct my mistakes, but I have wasted my time and I am afraid that I will not achieve anything in the end.\" Lu Yun said, \"The ancients cherished morality and believed that 'even if I understand the truth in the morning, I will be willing to die in the evening.' Besides, your future is still promising. Besides, people are afraid of not being able to set their goals. As long as you can set your goals and work hard to achieve them, why worry about not spreading your good reputation?\" After hearing this, Zhou Chu decided to reform himself and eventually became a loyal minister and filial son.",

Because the aircraft carrier is different from the ground airport, and its flight deck area is quite limited, and various types of personnel are quite concentrated. In order to maintain a good working order and facilitate recognition and unified command and management, people with different tasks must wear military uniforms of different colors. Those wearing yellow uniforms are usually shipboard observers, responsible for the takeoff and landing of carrier aircraft and the safety of people around them; those wearing blue uniforms are usually responsible for aircraft wheel stops and aircraft air intake plugs; those wearing red uniforms are only responsible for lifesaving, salvaging and firefighting; those wearing green uniforms are only responsible for aircraft takeoff and ejection and landing blocking; those wearing purple uniforms are mainly responsible for aircraft fuel filling; those wearing white uniforms are all maintenance personnel, mainly responsible for aircraft inspection, maintenance and repair; those wearing white uniforms with red crosses are mainly shipboard medical personnel.\n\nTherefore, the uniforms of various personnel in Yuanwang are clearly marked, the colors are also very eye-catching, the division of labor is clear, and each performs their duties, which not only improves work efficiency but also reduces the occurrence of accidents.",

In addition, people have different likes and dislikes, and different interests. Even if saints are like Yi and Zhou, and virtuous people are like Mo and Yang, who can avoid being criticized and blamed? In the past, Zigong asked Confucius, \"If all the villagers like it, what should I do?\" Confucius said, \"Not yet.\" \"If all the villagers hate it, what should I do?\" Confucius said, \"Not yet. It's better for the good villagers to like it and the bad to hate it.\" The intentions of gentlemen and villains must be opposite.

Why can leeks continue to grow after being cut? This is because it has many scales growing underground, and the scales store a lot of nutrients for the growth of leek leaves. Leek leaves grow very fast, because the leaves do not grow from the tip of the leaf, but grow upward from the center of the scales, so after cutting off the upper leek leaves, the lower ones will grow again. Generally, from spring to autumn, leeks can be cut once every 40 days. If there is enough fertilizer, it can be harvested 5 to 6 times a year.",

The following gifts are very suitable for long-distance boyfriends! \n① Scarf\nThe weather is getting colder and winter is coming. Is my dear living well in the distance? This must be something you will worry about. Take advantage of his birthday and send him a warm and beautiful scarf~ Scarves suitable for boys are blue, gray, coffee, etc. If you have time, you can also knit one by hand. Scarves made by yourself are more likely to be liked by him! \n② Couple jewelry\nMany couples like to wear clothes and jewelry with each other's marks, such as the same couple outfits, jewelry engraved with each other's names, such as couple rings, earrings, bracelets, pendants, etc. These are very suitable as birthday gifts. Now there are many stores that can make couple DIY jewelry. Wear one yourself and send another to your long-distance boyfriend. Even if the two are not together, the hearts are connected. \n③ Flowers\nHow can flowers be absent when celebrating your boyfriend's birthday? Flowers can make the already strong love more lingering and make the romance more romantic~ For your boyfriend’s birthday, you can send sunflowers, red roses, perfumed lilies, etc. These flowers represent love and warmth, and will send him full of tender care from afar. It is recommended not to send a single flower. Sending a bouquet composed of multiple flowers looks richer and more thoughtful! \nFor a long-distance boyfriend’s birthday, it is good if the two can be together, but if they can’t be together, at least the gift should be in place to be considered serious.",

        "output": "The washing machine was invented in the 19th century. Washing machines are generally divided into agitator washing machines, pulsator washing machines and drum washing machines. Agitator washing machines are the origin of modern laundry technology. It is the first real revolution in laundry technology, which has liberated human hands.\n\n　　Agitator washing machines apply the principle of agitation to clean clothes through chemical and mechanical actions. Pulsator washing machines have a simpler structure and are divided into two types: double-cylinder semi-automatic and fully automatic pulsators. The strong water flow generated by the rapid rotation of the bottom pulsator is used as the power, and the mutual friction between clothes, water flow and drum wall is used to remove dirt.\n\n　　Currently, drum washing machines are popular all over the world. After more than 80 years of technological development, they represent mature modern laundry technology. The washing principle is to lift and drop clothes and water by rotating the inner drum clockwise and counterclockwise, so that the detergent can fully penetrate into the clothes, and the clothes are cleaned by squeezing, beating and spraying water from above. The drum washing machine not only leads another new revolution in washing technology, but also with the development of intelligence, the technology will be improved day by day.\n\n　　The washing machine without washing powder is a new type of ultrasonic washing machine, which does not need to add any substances. Its working principle is that the high-frequency oscillation signal emitted by the ultrasonic generator is converted into high-frequency oscillation through the transducer and transmitted to the water, causing the water flow to generate tens of thousands of small bubbles. The instantaneous high pressure causes the bubbles to produce a series of small \"explosions\", which continuously impact the surface of the clothes, causing the dirt on the surface of the clothes and in the gaps of the clothes to fall off quickly.",

They can go without eating for months without losing their ferocity.\n\nWolves are used to going out at night. After dusk, hungry wolves often go out in groups to forage. They howl softly while walking. The calls of animals are communication signals for mutual contact. Different calls are made in different situations, and the calls are also closely related to reproductive habits.\n\nWolves howl at night to gather together. For example, female wolves often call their young, and male wolves call their females. After gathering in a group, they go out to hunt. During the breeding season, wolves also often howl to find mates. When hungry, young wolves will make sharp calls.\n\nWolves seriously endanger poultry, livestock and various wild animals.

When crossing the Yangtze River, the left prime minister Rui appointed him as the military advisor. Ti lived in Jingkou and gathered brave men. He said to Rui, \"The chaos of the Jin Dynasty was not caused by the lack of justice of the emperor and the resentment of the people. It was caused by the struggle for power among the royal family and the mutual destruction of each other, which allowed the Rongdi to take advantage of the opportunity and poison the Central Plains. Now that the remaining people have suffered from cruelty and robbery, people want to fight for themselves. If the king can really order a general to go out and let someone like Ti lead them to recover the Central Plains, the heroes of the counties and states will surely respond to the call.\" Rui had no ambition to fight in the north, so he appointed Ti as the general of fighting for power and the governor of Yuzhou, and gave him food for a thousand people and three thousand pieces of cloth, but no armor and weapons, so that he could recruit himself. Ti led more than a hundred of his followers across the river. When they were in the middle of the river, they struck the oars and swore, \"If Zu Ti cannot clear the Central Plains and restore the river, he will be as bad as the Yangtze River!\" Then he stationed in Huaiyin, started smelting and casting soldiers, and recruited more than 2,000 people before advancing.",

When he and Liu Kun were sleeping in the same bedroom, he heard the crowing of a cock in the middle of the night. He kicked Liu Kun awake and said, \"This is not a disgusting sound (or an ominous sign).\" Then he got up and danced with a sword. After crossing the Yangtze River, the left prime minister Sima Rui made him the chief military priest. Zu Ti lived in Jingkou and gathered a group of brave and strong soldiers. He said to Sima Rui: \"The turmoil in the Jin Dynasty was not caused by the monarch's unjust behavior, which made the ministers resentful and rebellious, but rather the struggle for power among the royal relatives and the killing of each other. This allowed the Rongdi people to take advantage of the opportunity and spread the scourge throughout the Central Plains. Now that the remnants of the Jin Dynasty have been devastated and harmed, everyone wants to strengthen themselves. If you can send generals to lead the troops and send people like me to lead the army to recover the Central Plains, there will definitely be heroes from all over the country who will be infected by the environment and respond positively!\" Sima Rui never had the ambition to march north. After listening to Zu Ti's words, he appointed Zu Ti as General Fenwei and Governor of Yuzhou, and only allocated him food for a thousand people and three thousand pieces of cloth. He did not provide him with armor and weapons, and let Zu Ti find a way to recruit them himself. Zu Ti led his private army of more than one hundred households across the Yangtze River. While beating the oars in the river, he said, \"If Zu Ti cannot bring peace to the Central Plains and succeed in the restoration, he will be like the great river, going there without return!\" So he stationed in Huaiyin, built a furnace to smelt and cast weapons, recruited more than 2,000 people, and then continued to move forward.",

Players who are good at looping and slicing balls all choose reverse-stick rackets. Because the racket with the rubber particles facing inwards has an extra layer of rubber particles between the rubber and the sponge, and there are gaps between the rubber particles.

First, characters were engraved on the slips and then holes were punched on one side of them. Then, they were woven together with silk ropes or cowhide belts to form a book shaped like the word \"ce\". Because there was a layer of bamboo green on the surface of the bamboo pole, which contained oil and water components, it was not easy to engrave characters, and bamboo was easily eaten by insects, so the ancients came up with a method of roasting bamboo slips on fire. Bamboo slips that have been roasted are easy to engrave characters and are resistant to insects, so roasting is an important process in the production of bamboo slips.\nAt that time, people called this process \"killing green\", also called \"hanqing\" and \"hanjian\". This is how the term \"killing green\" came about. In the Qin Dynasty, pens were available, so the characters on the slips could be written with pens instead of knives. At that time, people often used brushes to write the first draft on bamboo green because the bamboo green was smooth and they only needed to wipe it off to make revisions. After the first draft was revised, the bamboo green was scraped off and the final draft was written on bamboo white. This procedure was also called \"killing the green\".",

When sunlight shines on objects, various objects have different absorption and reflection abilities for light of different wavelengths, thus forming various colors. In short, if an object can reflect one or several types of light in the sunlight and absorb the rest of the light, then the object will present the color of the reflected single or complex light. Among visible light, red light has the longest light wave and the smallest deflection angle, and it is easy to pass through water layers, raindrops, dust and fog. Orange and yellow light are not afraid of obstacles and can penetrate the above objects. So the fire truck is painted red so that people can see it from a distance in foggy weather, dusty environment, or in heavy rain and storms, and make way for it so that it can complete its fire-fighting and rescue mission as quickly as possible.",

Kaizen is most often associated with manufacturing, such as Toyota, but has also been used in non-manufacturing settings. Exploitation can take the form of an individual, a suggestion system, a small group, or a large group. At Toyota, this is usually a local improvement in a certain workstation or area, and involves a small group improving their own work environment and productivity. This group of people is usually guided by a front-line supervisor in the exploratory effort; sometimes this is also a key role for the line supervisor. Productivity is improved through the use of machines and computing power, total quality management is achieved, and human labor is freed up. While kaizen (at Toyota) typically results in small improvements, the culture of constantly adjusting small improvements and standardization produces large results in overall productivity improvements. This philosophy is different from the \"command and control\" improvement programs (e.g., business process improvement) of the mid-20th century. The kaizen approach involves making changes, monitoring results, and then adjusting. Large-scale up-front planning and extensive project scheduling are replaced by smaller experiments that can be adapted quickly as new improvements are suggested. They are limited in scope, and the questions that arise from them are often used in later lightning events. Those who have made significant contributions to the successful implementation of Kaizen during the Kaizen event are awarded the title of \"Kaizen\". As a way to help clients restructure and reposition their business processes, in the 21st century, business consultants in various countries began to widely adopt and share the Kaizen framework.

Please speak your mind.\" The ministers all said, \"Your Majesty's merits are like heaven and earth, and all things cannot be named.\" The emperor said, \"No. The reason why I can achieve this is only due to five things. Since ancient times, emperors often hate those who are better than themselves. I see the good in others as if I have it myself. People's behavior and ability cannot be perfect at the same time. I always abandon their shortcomings and take their strengths. The ruler often promotes the virtuous and wants to put them in his care. , and when I dismiss the unworthy, I want to push them into the abyss. When I see a virtuous person, I respect him, and when I see an unworthy person, I pity him, and the virtuous and the unworthy are each in their proper place. Most rulers hate the upright, and punish them secretly or openly, without a single generation without this. Since I ascended the throne, upright people have been shoulder to shoulder in the court, and I have never dismissed or blamed a single one. Since ancient times, people have valued the Chinese and despised the barbarians and the Di people. I alone love them all equally, so their tribes all rely on me like their parents. These five are the reasons why I have achieved what I have today. ” He turned to Chu Suiliang and said, “You have been a historian.

Please speak frankly.\" The ministers all said: \"Your Majesty's merits are as vast as the heaven and earth, and there is nothing to say about other things.\" Emperor Taizong of Tang said: \"You can't say that. The reason why I have such merits is that I have achieved five things: First, since ancient times, emperors have been jealous of those who are better than themselves. When I see the advantages of others, I treat them as my own advantages, as if they were my own advantages. Second, everyone's behavioral ability cannot be perfect, so I abandon their shortcomings and take their strengths. Third, most monarchs, when they see good people, want to hold them in their arms; when they see bad people, want to push them into the abyss. But I respect talented people when I see them; when I see people who perform poorly, I educate them from the perspective of love. So that both the virtuous and the unvirtuous can be in their proper place. Fourth, most monarchs do not like people to criticize them in person, and secretly harm or openly attack those who speak out. There is no dynasty that is not like this. Since I took the throne, there have been many people who speak out, and no one has been dismissed because of this. Fifth, the tradition regards the Han people as noble and discriminates against ethnic minorities, but I am the only one who treats them equally and loves them, so ethnic minorities rely on me like they rely on their parents.

It is easy to govern when the people are rich, and it is difficult to govern when the people are poor. Why do we say this? When the people are rich, they will be content with their hometown and cherish their home. When they are content with their hometown and cherish their home, they will respect the monarch and fear punishment. When they respect the monarch and fear punishment, it is easy to govern. When the people are poor, they will be dissatisfied with their hometown and despise their home. When they are dissatisfied with their hometown and despise their home, they will dare to resist the monarch and violate the prohibitions. When they resist the monarch and violate the prohibitions, it is difficult to govern. Therefore, a well-governed country is often rich, and a chaotic country is bound to be poor.

You may also see areas of hair loss or red spots on the animal's skin.\n\nUse a flea comb to search your dog's coat for these tiny creatures. You're most likely to find them on your pet's neck, belly, lower back, and base of the tail.\n\nIf you don't see actual fleas, you may find their feces, or \"dust ants.\" They look like tiny black peppers on your dog's skin.",

Its flowers bloom for several days and change color day by day.

Therefore, when you have a fever, you must drink more boiled water to replenish the deficiency, otherwise you will become dehydrated and the disease will be aggravated.\n\nIn addition, water has the function of regulating body temperature. Drinking more water can lower body temperature through the evaporation of sweat or the excretion of urine to dissipate heat. In addition, some diseases are caused by the invasion of pathogenic bacteria. Drinking more water, water is absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and enters the blood, which can dilute the toxins produced by bacteria in the blood and excrete them with urine. When you have a high fever, your body's metabolism is often disrupted, and products that are harmful to the body appear in your blood. Similarly, drinking more water can dilute and carry away these harmful substances, reducing their adverse effects on the body.",

If you are not sure whether you can make a U-turn safely, it is best to choose another place or method to change direction.

        "output": "Case content: Xiaohan encountered a puzzling problem when she recently bought an LCD TV. Although she had done her homework before buying the TV, when she compared the two products she liked in the store, she found that the screen of one of the two products with the same 32-inch mark seemed to be a little smaller than the other. It stands to reason that the screen, which is a component that meets the standardized production, should not be so different. Could it be that her vision is wrong? But Xiaohan firmly believes that only 100 degrees of myopia is not enough to cause such a misunderstanding. So what is going on? How is the screen size calculated? Is it true that the screens of different products of the same size are different sizes?\n\nExpert interpretation: Screen size is actually the first thing consumers consider when buying a machine, but it is also the first thing they ignore. For most consumers, 32 inches or 42 inches are just concepts, with only a difference in size, but no actual visual comparison. In fact, the screen size of an LCD TV is measured by the length of the diagonal of the TV screen, and the unit is usually inches (1 inch is equivalent to 2.538 cm).\n\n　　Due to the screen characteristics of LCD screens, they will not be obscured by frame lines, so generally speaking, the screen size of LCD TVs will not vary, and because LCD screens are cut according to the full size, there is usually no phenomenon of missing an inch or half an inch. However, this is only a common situation. There are also a few manufacturers in the market who use non-A-grade screens or screens with substandard craftsmanship to reduce their production costs, resulting in a screen size that is 1 to 2 cm smaller than the standard size, which seems a little smaller. Another situation is that some manufacturers have to sacrifice the size of the screen slightly in order to adjust the physical resolution of the screen. In view of this, when consumers buy LCD TVs, it is best to choose a big brand to avoid the phenomenon of \"short weight\" of the screen.",

When the vortex effect increases to a certain extent, a tornado is formed.\n\nIn addition, the temperature difference between the upper and lower layers is large, the cold air drops rapidly, and the hot air rises violently. The upper and lower layers of air are alternately disturbed, forming many small vortices. These small vortices gradually expand, surging up and down more and more violently, and finally form large vortices, which can also form tornadoes.",

On January 30, 1895, at 08:30, the Japanese army occupied the Motianling Fort. The Qing army's land forts immediately concentrated on attacking the Motianling Fort. Admiral Ding Ruchang of the Navy also led Dingyuan, Jingyuan, Laiyuan, Guangping, and several mosquito boats to approach the Nanbang Fort for auxiliary shooting. The Japanese army that captured the Motianling Fort took the opportunity to capture the weakly guarded Longmiaozui Fort and used it to attack the Beiyang Fleet in front of them. The sudden bombardment caught the Beiyang Fleet off guard. One of the shells hit the observation port of the Guangping command tower, and the assistant first mate Huang Zulian was killed in the battle. On February 1, the Beibang Fort was lost, and all land transportation in Weihaiwei was cut off. Dai Zongqian, the commander of the Sui Army defending Weihai, committed suicide. The Japanese army then used light ships to attack the Beiyang Fleet's berth several times. After 04:00 on the 6th, the Japanese torpedo boat team launched a fourth attack, and at the same time, the army artillery bombarded the north bank of Weihai. The four ships Jingyuan, Jiyuan, Pingyuan, and Guangping bombarded the north bank, and the rest of the ships bombarded the torpedo boat team. The Beiyang Fleet was under heavy siege and lacked assistance. After many days of fighting, only Pingyuan, Jiyuan, and Guangping were still able to fight in the port, and the large-caliber artillery shells in each ship had long been exhausted. Seeing that there was no hope of breaking out and rescue was delayed, Ding Ruchang ordered the sinking of all damaged ships to avoid aiding the enemy. On the 9th, Guangping sank the stranded Jingyuan with a torpedo, and then approached Dingyuan and placed 350 pounds of explosives in the middle of the ship. At 15:15, the explosives exploded, destroying the engine room of Dingyuan, and the two chimneys of Dingyuan also fell to one side. On the 11th, Ding Ruchang committed suicide by taking poison. In the following days, the captain of Guangping, Cheng Biguang, and the director of Weihaiwei Camp Affairs Office, Niu Changying, went in and out of Songdao many times to discuss surrender. At 08:30 on the 17th, the combined fleet entered Weihaiwei Port. The remaining ten ships of the Beiyang Fleet, including Guangping, lowered the Qing Dynasty flag and raised the Japanese flag.",

This work is called \"modulation\" in communication technology and is completed by a \"modulator\". The \"modulator\" can modulate different voice and image signals into optical signals with different frequency bands. Since the frequency band of light waves is very wide, there is a lot of room for selection, which can meet the needs of a large number of different telephone frequency bands.\n\n　　Theoretically, on such a wide frequency band of optical fiber, it is not a problem for 100 million people to talk at the same time. However, due to the limitations of the optoelectronic conversion equipment itself, this capacity cannot be achieved in practice, but it is not a problem to allow thousands of telephones to communicate unimpeded at the same time! In actual use, tens of thousands of phone calls or thousands of TV programs can be transmitted simultaneously on an optical fiber thinner than a hair.\n\nIf dozens of optical fibers are combined into one optical cable, its capacity can be imagined.",
