In a moment's notice, he urgently ordered tea to be prepared, followed by wine and food. He also instructed that the horses be fed and the servants be fed. My aunt remarked, 'Why was he so haughty earlier, and now he is so respectful?' When he entered the gate, he had a pleased expression and invited me to rest in the academic hall.

When Pei Ji was young, his maternal uncle held an official position in the court and had a good reputation for being a just and honest official.

His uncle heaved a deep sigh and muttered to himself, \"Who is this Cui Zhao, and why do so many speak highly of him? He must have bribed his way to such praise. If things continue like this, how can our country not fall into chaos?\" \n\nBefore Pei Ji's uncle could finish his words, the gatekeeper interrupted and announced, \"Lord Cui, the Governor of Shouzhou, requests an audience with you, my lord.\" Hearing this, Pei Ji's uncle became furious and scolded the gatekeeper. He ordered the man to drive Lord Cui away with a whip. After a long while, Lord Cui straightened his clothes and forcibly paid respects to Pei Ji's uncle. Soon after, Pei Ji's uncle hurriedly instructed the servants to serve tea to Lord Cui. Then, he ordered the preparation of a feast, and shortly after, he commanded that Lord Cui's horse be fed and his servants be given a meal.\n\nAfter seeing Lord Cui off, Pei Ji's aunt asked her husband, \"Why were you so arrogant at first and then so humble?\" Pei Ji's uncle, with a look of benevolence on his face, walked into the house and waved for Pei Ji to leave. He said, \"Go and rest in the study.\" As Pei Ji stepped out of the house, before he had even descended the front steps, he turned back and saw his uncle take out a piece of paper from his breast pocket.

As such, in most areas, the EU is controlled by the US and \"NATO\" and must cooperate with US strategy.\n\nII. The US has Ukraine under its control. Before the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US successfully plotted and carried out a \"color revolution\" in Ukraine, overthrowing the previously pro-Russia Ukrainian President Yanukovych. The Ukrainian governments that came to power after the color revolution were obedient to the US, acting as its vassal. At the instigation of the US, Ukraine shifted from being \"pro-Russia\" to being \"anti-Russia\".\n\nIII. Ukraine itself requested to join \"NATO\". After Ukraine overthrew its pro-Russia regime, its foreign policy tilted entirely towards the West. Ukraine has been accommodating the US and the Western strategy to curb Russia in every way, actively seeking to join \"NATO\" to better integrate itself into the West. Ukraine is willing to be used by the West as a gun to target its \"motherland\", Russia.\n\nIV. The West sees Ukraine as strategically valuable. Obviously, Ukraine is a major country in Europe, and it is worth it for the US and the West to \"cultivate\" another powerful \"fighter\" to defeat Russia. Since Ukraine has a certain capacity to \"entangle\" with Russia, in this Russia-Ukraine conflict, the EU will spare no effort to help Ukraine, aiming to thoroughly defeat Russia in this battle.",

This phenomenon occurs due to the reflection and refraction of sunlight as it passes through water droplets in the air. \n\nAs we know, when sunlight passes through a prism, its direction changes, and the original white light is decomposed into various colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. During or after rain, the air is filled with countless tiny water droplets that can refract sunlight. When sunlight passes through these droplets, not only is its direction altered, but it is also decomposed into the colors mentioned above. If the angle is right, a rainbow is formed and can be observed by us. \n\nThe size of the water droplets in the air determines the vividness of the rainbow's colors. The larger the droplets, the more vibrant the rainbow; conversely, smaller droplets result in a paler rainbow. Summer is often accompanied by thunderstorms or showers, which usually have a limited range, meaning that it is possible to have sunshine in one place while it is raining in another. When sunlight shines on the small water droplets lingering in the air after a rain shower, a beautiful rainbow appears. \n\nIn comparison, winter is drier, with fewer rainy days, and precipitation mostly occurs in the form of snow, which does not create rainbows. Therefore, rainbows are less commonly observed in winter. However, in very rare cases, when the atmospheric conditions are just right, a rainbow may still appear in the winter sky.",

The foundation of their success lay in the ambitious strategies of Sun Ce and Sun Quan. However, the real pillars of the state, the heroes whose loyalty ensured the survival of the kingdom, were four men: Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lü Meng, and Lu Xun. Throughout history, generals have always been proud of their abilities and resented those who surpassed them. But these four men were different. When Sun Quan first took charge, Lu Su wanted to return north, but Zhou Yu stopped him and recommended Lu Su to Sun Quan, saying, 'Lu Su's talent is suited for assisting the times. We should seek out more talented individuals like him to achieve greatness.' Later, when Zhou Yu was on his deathbed, he wrote to Sun Quan, 'Lu Su is loyal and valiant, and he never takes matters lightly. If you choose him to succeed me, my death will not be in vain.' And so Lu Su took Zhou Yu's place as commander. When Lü Meng was the magistrate of Xunyang, Lu Su met with him and said, 'Your talent and wisdom have far surpassed those of the old Wu people.' He then paid respects to Lü Meng's mother, formed a friendship with him, and parted ways. Lü Meng went on to succeed Lu Su. When Lü Meng was stationed at Lukou and feigned illness to return home, Sun Quan asked, 'Who can replace him?' Lü Meng replied, 'Lu Xun has a profound understanding and the talent to shoulder great responsibilities. Observing his strategic thinking, I believe he is fully capable of taking on this important role, and there will be no more mistakes.' And thus Lu Xun succeeded Lü Meng. These four men took turns holding the fort at the western border for three to four decades, establishing themselves as formidable generals. They thwarted Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Guan Yu. Although they recommended each other for their respective roles, Sun Quan entrusted them with all his heart, and this is how the kingdom of Wu thrived—it was no accident.\"",
        "output": "The reason why Sun Wu was able to hold on to Jiangdong and compete with the Central Plains was fundamentally due to the extraordinary talents and grand strategies of Sun Ce and Sun Quan. At that time, among the outstanding heroes of Eastern Wu, there were four people, Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lü Meng, and Lu Xun, who were regarded as the pillars of the state. They were all ministers who were willing to share the fate of the country. However, since ancient times, most generals and commanders believed themselves to be capable and wise, fearing that others might surpass them. But the wise men mentioned above were not like that. When Sun Quan had just taken over the reign, Lu Su, a man from the north, intended to go north to the Jiangbei region to join Cao Cao. Zhou Yu stopped him and recommended Lu Su to Sun Quan, saying, \"Lu Su's talent is suitable for assisting the ruler. We should seek more talented individuals like him to achieve great undertakings.\" Later, when Zhou Yu was on his deathbed, he wrote a letter to Sun Quan, recommending, \"Lu Su is loyal and valiant, and he never takes a task lightly. If you can use him to replace me, I will have no regrets even if I die!\" Thus, Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu in leading the army. Lü Meng served as the prefect of Xuning, and when Lu Su saw him, he said, \"Your talent and wisdom today are no longer the same as when you were the young boy from Wu (as Lü Meng had acquired a vast amount of knowledge by then).\" Lu Su then paid a respectful visit to Lü Meng's mother, formed a friendship with him, and parted ways. Later, Lü Meng also succeeded Lu Su in commanding the army. When Lü Meng was stationed at Lukou and fell ill, he requested to resign, and Sun Quan asked, \"Who can replace you?\" Lü Meng replied, \"Lu Xun has profound wisdom and talent capable of bearing heavy responsibilities. Observing his strategic thinking, I believe he can be entrusted with a crucial task, and he will not make any mistakes.\" Thus, Lu Xun succeeded Lü Meng. These four individuals took turns leading the army in the western border region for three to four decades, establishing themselves as formidable generals. They defeated Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Guan Yu. Although they recommended each other, Sun Quan was also willing to listen to their suggestions and entrust them with important responsibilities.

Those bulls, weighing hundreds to thousands of kilograms, seem to have a grudge against the red cloth, constantly charging with full force. Therefore, we naturally assume that red is the color that provokes the bull's anger. Is this really the case?\n\nNo. In fact, bulls are completely color blind. Whether you wave a red or a white cloth in front of them, it makes no difference to them. There are several reasons why bulls become enraged. First, this particular breed of bull naturally has a very irritable temperament; second, they have been confined in the bull pen for a long time and are already impatient; third, and most importantly, the matador waving the cloth in front of them makes them uncomfortable. Bulls are very sensitive to moving objects, and the waving cloth makes them think that it is an opponent, so they charge forward blindly, wanting to show their strength. However, if the opponent doesn't move, for example, if the matador poses gracefully, the bull won't even pay attention to him.\n\nThen why do matadors use a red cloth for bullfighting? This is because red is a more stimulating color to the human eye, and the audience in the arena is more likely to get excited when they see red. When the audience is boiling, the performance effect will be particularly good. Therefore, the red cloth is not used to provoke the bull, but to entertain the audience.",

The movement's key figures included Monet (Claude Monet), Renoir (Pierre-Auguste Renoir), and Degas (Edgar Degas). Artists of the Indian Ocean School were characterized by their capture of light and color at different moments, emphasizing the representation of natural landscapes and everyday life. The name originated from an art critic who used the term \"Indian Ocean School\" to describe their work when reviewing Monet's paintings.\n\nAlthough the Indian Ocean School was initially treated with indifference, it gradually gained wide recognition and had a profound influence on subsequent modern art. The movement was marked by themes of natural light and color variations and the use of pointillist techniques to create more vibrant images. It is considered one of the important precursors to Impressionism and modern art.",

Sometimes he would rest under the shade of trees, building a simple hut with thatched grass, crafting brushes from reeds, and making ink by carving tree sap. On clear nights, he studied under the light of the stars and moon, and when it was dark, he tied bunches of hemp and mugwort to illuminate his path. When reading a book and coming across a passage that resonated with him, he would jot down notes on his clothing to remember it. His dedication to learning inspired his disciples, who offered him clean garments in place of the ones he had marked up.

One should not assume that a person is good just because the villagers like him, nor should one hate him just because they dislike him.\" This is because the actions of good and bad people will surely differ.

It comprises the heart, blood vessels (including arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood. \n\nThe heart is a muscular organ about the size of a fist, located between the lungs in the chest cavity. It pumps blood continuously through the network of blood vessels, ensuring a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body. The heart has four chambers: the right atrium, the right ventricle, the left atrium, and the left ventricMultiplier. Blood flows from the body and enters the right atrium, then moves to the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium, from where it passes to the left ventricle, which then pumps the oxygen-rich blood through the aorta to be distributed to the body. \n\nThe blood vessels form a complex network that carries blood to and from the heart, as well as between different organs and tissues. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, veins carry blood back to the heart, and capillaries are tiny vessels that connect arteries and veins and enable the exchange of water, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the body's cells. \n\nIn summary, the cardiovascular system is vital for maintaining the body's overall health and homeostasis, ensuring the delivery of essential nutrients and oxygen to cells and removing waste products. The proper functioning of this system is crucial for the well-being and survival of an individual.",

Thus, we can say that the calamity lay in bribing Qin.\n\nApart from its military conquests, Qin gained small cities in some cases and large cities in others. Comparing what Qin gained through bribery to what it gained through victory in battle, the former was actually a hundred times more. Comparing what the feudal lords lost through bribery to what they lost through defeat in battle, the latter was also a hundred times more. Thus, what Qin greatly desired and what the feudal lords greatly feared certainly did not lie in battle. \n\nRecalling their ancestors who endured frost and dew and cut through brambles and thorns to gain a small piece of land, their descendants do not value it very much and simply give it away to others, treating it like discarded weeds. Today they cede five cities, and tomorrow they cede ten cities, and only then can they sleep soundly for a night. When they wake up and look at their borders, the Qin army has arrived again. Thus, the land of the feudal lords is limited, while Qin's greed is insatiable. The more they serve it, the more demands it makes, and the more it encroaches. Therefore, without even fighting, the strong and weak, and the victorious and defeated, have already been decided. When it came to the five states' destruction, it was only logical. As the old saying goes: \"Giving land to Qin to appease it is like carrying firewood to put out a fire. If the firewood does not run out, the fire will not go out.\" This saying hits the mark.\n\nThe people of Qi never bribed Qin and eventually followed the five states into destruction. Why? Because they allied with Qin and did not aid the five states. Once the five states were destroyed, Qi also could not escape its fate. The rulers of Yan and Zhao were the first to have a far-sighted strategy, able to defend their territory, and they did not bribe Qin out of a sense of righteousness. Thus, although Yan was a small state, it was the last to perish, and this was the effectiveness of their military strategy. When it came to using Jing Ke to assassinate Qin Shi Huang, they only hastened their destruction. Zhao fought five battles with Qin, losing two and winning three. Later, Qin attacked Zhao twice, but General Li Mu repulsed them both times. When Li Mu was executed due to slander, Handan became a county, and it was a pity that his use of the military was not continued. Moreover, Yan and Zhao were situated at a time when Qin was on the verge of destroying all the states, and they could be described as having limited resources and being in a perilous situation. Their defeat and destruction were truly unavoidable. If only the three states had each cherished their territory, if the people of Qi had not attached themselves to Qin, if the assassins had not been sent, and if the capable generals had still been there, then the odds of victory or defeat and the principles of existence or destruction would have been comparable to Qin's, and it may not have been easy to determine the outcome.\n\nAlas! If the land that was used to bribe Qin had been used to seal the titles of the wise and capable ministers in the world, and if the hearts that served Qin had been used to honor the extraordinary talents in the world, and if their combined strength had been directed westward, then I fear that the people of Qin would not have been able to swallow their food. What a pity! With such power, they were intimidated by Qin's accumulated might, gradually losing land and marching towards destruction. Oh, rulers of the states, never let yourselves be intimidated by accumulated might!\n\nThe six states and Qin were all feudal lords, and their power was weaker than that of Qin, but they still had the power to not bribe and defeat it. If you use the vastness of the world and follow the story of the six states' destruction, then you are even lower than the six states.",
        "output": "The demise of the Six States was not because their weapons were not sharp or they fought poorly. The problem lay in bribing Qin with land. Bribing Qin with land weakened their own power, and this was the reason for their downfall. Some may ask, \"Did all six states perish one after the other simply because they bribed Qin?\" (The answer is) \"Those states that did not bribe Qin perished because of those that did. The reason was that the non-bribing states lost their strong external support and could not survive on their own. Thus, we say the problem was bribing Qin.\"\n\nQin not only seized land through warfare but also received bribes from the feudal lords. The smaller bribes resulted in townships, while the larger ones yielded cities. Comparing the land Qin obtained through bribes to that gained through victories over other states, the former was actually a hundred times greater. The land lost by the feudal lords of the Six States through bribes far exceeded that lost in defeat, also by a hundredfold. So, what Qin desired most and what the Six States feared most had nothing to do with war. Thinking of their forefathers who braved the cold and toiled through the rain, hacking through brambles and thorns to gain a tiny bit of land, only for their descendants to squander it all by giving it away, treating it as worthless as discarded grass—today, they cede five cities, and tomorrow, ten, only then can they sleep soundly for a night. But upon waking the next day and looking around, they see Qin's armies again. Since this is the case, with the finite land of the feudal lords and the insatiable greed of the violent Qin state, the more the lords give, the more urgently Qin invades. Thus, without resorting to war, the balance of power and the outcome of victory or defeat have already been decided. When it reaches the point of annihilation, the logic is as such. The ancients said, \"Using land to serve Qin is like carrying firewood to put out a fire. As long as the firewood doesn't burn up, the fire won't go out.\" This saying is very true.\n\nQi never bribed Qin, yet it ultimately perished along with the Five States. Why? Because it befriended Qin and did not aid the other five states. With the Five States gone, Qi could not escape its fate. The rulers of Yan and Zhao initially had far-sighted strategies, able to defend their territories, uphold justice, and refrain from bribing Qin. Thus, although Yan was a small state, it perished later, and this was the effect of resisting Qin by force. Later, when Crown Prince Dan of Yan sent Jing Ke to assassinate the King of Qin, this act invited calamity. Zhao once fought five battles with Qin, losing twice and winning thrice. Later, Qin attacked Zhao twice, but (Zhao's general) Li Mu repeatedly repulsed Qin's offensives. Eventually, Li Mu was framed and killed, and Handan (Zhao's capital) became a Qin district. It was unfortunate that Zhao, in resisting Qin with force, could not hold out in the end. Moreover, Yan and Zhao were in a situation where Qin had almost wiped out the other states, and one could say they were intellectually exhausted, their states isolated and imperiled. Their defeat and destruction were indeed unavoidable. If Han, Wei, and Chu cherished their territories, if Qi did not side with Qin, if the assassin (from Yan) had not gone (to kill the King of Qin), and if the capable general Li Mu had lived, then the fortunes of victory and defeat, the principles of existence and destruction—when compared with Qin—may not have been easily measurable.\n\nAlas! (If the feudal lords) had used the land they bribed Qin with to reward the strategists of the world, and with the heart they served Qin, treated the exceptional talents of the world, uniting as one and facing west (toward Qin), then I fear the people of Qin wouldn't even be able to swallow their food. How lamentable! With such advantageous circumstances, they were coerced by Qin's long-established might, ceding land day after day, month after month, until they met their demise. Oh, rulers of states, do not be coerced by long-established might!\n\nThe Six States and Qin were all feudal states, and although their power was weaker than Qin's, they still had the advantage of being able to defeat Qin without bribing it. If one relies on a vast state yet follows the precedent of the Six States' downfall, one is even worse off than the Six States.",

        "output": "The scholar He Yue once found more than 200 taels of silver while walking at night. He did not dare to tell his family about it, worrying that they would advise him to keep the silver. The next morning, he returned to the place where he had found the silver and saw a man searching for something. He asked the man about the amount of silver and the seal, and the man's answers matched. So, he returned the silver to the man. The man wanted to give him a portion of the silver as a token of gratitude, but He Yue said, \"I found the silver, and no one else knows about it. All the silver could have been mine, so why would I be tempted by these few taels?\" The man thanked him and left.\n\nWhen He Yue was teaching at an official's home, the official sometimes had to go to the capital and left a box with He Yue, containing hundreds of taels of silver. The official told He Yue to keep it safe and retrieve it when he returned. However, the official would be away for years at a time, with no news. When He Yue heard that the official's nephew was coming to the south for another matter, he entrusted the box to the nephew to return it to the official in the capital.\n\nHe Yue, a poor scholar, demonstrated his integrity by returning the silver he found. His lack of greed in the short term is commendable, but what is even more remarkable is that he did not give in to temptation even though the official left the silver in his care for years. His noble character far surpasses that of ordinary people!",

The principle of prioritizing the physical and mental health of the children and safeguarding their lawful rights and interests;\n2. For children in the breastfeeding period, the principle is to follow and be raised by the breastfeeding mother;\n3. For children after the breastfeeding period, the principle is to prioritize mutual consultation between both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the court will make a judgment based on the children's interests and the specific circumstances of both parents;\n4. In the event of a dispute over a minor child aged ten or above living with the father or the mother, the court will consider the minor child's opinion appropriately. The parent who does not raise the child should pay child support, typically 20-30% of their income. Child support includes living expenses, education fees, medical expenses, etc. The specific amount of child support is determined based on the local living standards and the child's possible actual living expenses.\n\nArticle 1084 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China states: \"The relationship between parents and children shall not be eliminated due to the parents' divorce. After divorce, regardless of whether the children are directly raised by the father or the mother, they are still the mutual children of the parents.\n\nAfter divorce, the parents still have the rights and obligations of raising, educating, and protecting the children.\n\nAfter divorce, for children under the age of two, the principle is that they shall be directly raised by the mother. If the child is over two years old and the parents cannot reach an agreement on custody, the People's Court shall make a judgment based on the specific circumstances of both parties and according to the principle of the best interests of the minor. For children over eight years old, their genuine wishes shall be respected.\"",

Prepare banners in advance with phrases like \"Control Anger\" and \"Simmer Down,\" and then place them on your desk or hang them on the wall.\n\nWhat are the ways to stabilize emotions? \n\nTo regulate emotions, you can try the following methods: \n1. Physical activity regulation: During exercise, the human body's heart rate increases, promoting blood circulation and increasing the amount of oxygen inhaled. In this state, the brain becomes excited, and emotions improve. \n2. Reading regulation: Reading can effectively enhance concentration. When your attention is highly focused, your emotions will stabilize, and you will forget your worries.",

IAM consists of systems and processes that allow IT administrators to assign a single digital identity to each entity, authenticate them at login, authorize access to designated resources, and monitor and manage these identities throughout their lifecycle.\n\nIAM is no longer just for employees. Organizations must be able to provide secure access for contractors and business partners, remote and mobile users, and customers. With digital transformation, identities are also being assigned to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, robots, and code snippets such as APIs or microservices. Multi-cloud hybrid IT environments and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions further complicate the IAM landscape.\n\nAs it sits between users and critical enterprise assets, identity and access management is a key component of any enterprise security plan. It helps prevent user credential leaks and easily guessable passwords, which are common network entry points for criminal hackers looking to inject ransomware or steal data.\n\nWhen implemented properly, IAM helps ensure business productivity and the smooth running of digital systems. Employees can work seamlessly wherever they are, while centralized management ensures they only access specific resources necessary for their work. Opening up systems to customers, contractors, and suppliers can increase efficiency and reduce costs.",

        "output": "There are many speculations about the reason for Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The materials discovered after the war show that the Pearl Harbor incident was actually an energy war, or more precisely, an extreme measure taken by Japan in response to the oil embargo imposed by the United States.\n\nThe United States hoped to curb Japan by cutting off its energy supply\nOil, as an important strategic resource, has always been closely tied to wars. As an island country with limited resources, Japan's shortage of energy became a fatal weakness in its quest for world domination. In the late 1930s, 90% of Japan's domestic oil demand was met by imports, 85% of which came from the United States, the largest oil exporter at that time.\nBefore the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan had been waging a four-year war on the Asian continent, aiming to plunder the abundant natural resources in the region.\n\nJapan's aggression against Asian countries obviously posed a threat to the United States' interests in the Far East. However, isolationism in the United States also put the Roosevelt administration in a dilemma. Isolationists believed that the country should neither provide military aid to nations under the threat of war nor impose economic sanctions on aggressor states. Moreover, under pressure from the British government and the US Congress, President Roosevelt was advised not to engage in military conflict with Japan in the Pacific, as it would hinder future aid to allies and divert public attention away from Hitler's aggression plans.\n\nIn July 1940, the United States passed the Export Control Act, which provided President Roosevelt with a pretext to retaliate against Japan's rampant expansion in Asia. When the Japanese military began invading northern Indochina in September 1940, President Roosevelt used this act to impose an embargo on scrap iron and steel exports to Japan. Soon after, he also banned the export of aviation fuel and lubricants, stating that these materials could only be exported to the United Kingdom and other Western Hemisphere countries.\n\nAt the same time, the Japanese were also pondering and began to reevaluate their foreign policy. The military, especially the high-ranking officers, had been exerting a detrimental influence on diplomacy since the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo in Northeast China. The military leadership was also the main force advocating for an alliance with Germany and Italy, and they supported prolonging the war in China and further advancing into southern Asia to realize their imperial dream of energy self-sufficiency. In the summer of 1940, Duke Konoe Fumimaro became the Prime Minister of Japan. While the Konoe cabinet tacitly approved the military's further expansion in Asia, it also worked towards reconciliation with the United States. However, by authorizing the occupation of French Indochinese bases and signing the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, the Konoe cabinet left President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull with no room for concessions in the negotiations.\n\nIn the winter of 1940, Britain's transatlantic energy supply lines suffered devastating attacks from German submarines, which heightened US concerns about the situation. In April 1941, Germany occupied Yugoslavia and Greece and inflicted heavy casualties on the British military in Crete and North Africa. President Roosevelt had no choice but to extend the US neutrality zone in the Atlantic and further east to prevent a Hitler invasion. In May, President Roosevelt announced a strengthening of submarine tracking and escort efforts in the region and redeployed the Pacific Fleet to reinforce the Atlantic Fleet. As a result, the United States declared a state of national emergency, and Washington placed aiding Britain as an undisputed priority.",

        "instruction": "Here is the translation of the classical Chinese text into modern Chinese:\n\n墨子子墨子说：“仁人做事的准则，一定是兴天下之利，除天下之害。”那么，什么是天下的利益？什么是天下的祸害呢？墨子说：“现在如果国与国之间互相攻伐，家族与家族之间互相篡夺，人与人之间互相残杀，君臣之间不忠诚，父子之间不孝顺，兄弟之间不和睦，这些就是天下的祸害。”\n\n那么，观察这些祸害，又是什么原因造成的呢？是因为不相爱吗？墨子说：“是由于不相爱造成的。现在诸侯只知道爱自己的国家，不爱别的国家，所以不顾惜举起自己的国家去攻打别的国家。现在一家之主只知道爱自己的家庭，不爱别的家庭，所以不顾惜举起自己的家庭去篡夺别的家庭。现在人只知道爱自己，不爱别人，所以不顾惜举起自己去残害别人。因此，诸侯不相爱，就一定会野战；一家之主不相爱，就一定会互相篡夺；人与人不相爱，就一定会互相残杀；君臣不相爱，就不忠诚；父子不相爱，就不孝顺；兄弟不相爱，就不和睦。天下的人都不相爱，强势的就会欺压弱小的，富有的就会侮辱贫穷的，有权势的就会傲视卑微的，欺诈的就会欺骗愚直的。凡是天下的祸患、篡夺、怨恨，之所以产生，都是由于不相爱造成的，所以仁人批判它。”\n\n既然批判了它，又该用什么来取代它呢？墨子说：“用兼相爱、交相利的法则来取代它。”那么，什么是兼相爱、交相利的法则呢？墨子说：“看别人的国家就像看自己的国家，看别人的家庭就像看自己的家庭，看别人的身体就像看自己的身体。因此，诸侯互相爱护，就不会野战；一家之主互相爱护，就不会互相篡夺；人与人互相爱护，就不会互相残杀；君臣互相爱护，就忠诚；父子互相爱护，就孝顺；兄弟互相爱护，就和睦。天下的人都互相爱护，强势的不会欺压弱小的，众多的不会劫掠少数的，富有的不会侮辱贫穷的，有权势的不会傲视卑微的，欺诈的不会欺骗愚直的。凡是天下的祸患、篡夺、怨恨，都可以避免，都是因为互相爱护而产生的，所以仁人赞誉它。”\n\n然而，现在天下的士君子说：“兼爱确实很好。虽然如此，天下的人们很难改变旧有的习惯啊！”墨子说：“天下的士君子只是没有认识到它的好处，没有辨明其中的道理罢了。现在像攻打城池、野战、杀身成仁这些，都是天下百姓所难做到的，如果君王喜欢这些行为，那么士众也能做到。何况兼相爱、交相利与这些行为不同！爱别人的人，别人也会随之去爱他；利于别人的人，别人也会随之去利于他；害别人的人，别人也会随之去害他；恶意对待别人的人，别人也会随之恶意对待他。这有什么难的呢？只是君王不把它当作政治准则，士人不把它当作行为准则罢了。从前，晋文公喜欢士人穿破旧的衣服，所以文公的臣子们都穿牂羊皮做的皮裘，用皮革做带剑的腰带，头戴白绸帽，入宫拜见君王，出宫后在朝廷上行走。这是为什么呢？因为君王喜欢这样的行为，所以臣子们也这样做。从前，楚灵王喜欢士人吃得少，所以灵王的臣子们都以一顿饭为食，呼吸一下才系上腰带，扶着墙才站起来。一年多以后，朝堂上呈现出黧黑的颜色。这是为什么呢？因为君王喜欢这样的行为，所以臣子们也能这样做。从前，越王勾践喜欢士人的勇敢，训练他的臣子，私下让人放火烧船，考验他的臣子们，说：‘越国的宝物全部在这里！’越王亲自擂鼓，激励他的臣子们前进。臣子们听到鼓声，就拼命地冲向火中，左右有百余人丧命，越王敲响金器命令他们退下。”所以墨子说：“像吃得少、穿破旧的衣服、杀身成仁这些行为，都是天下百姓所难做到的，如果君王喜欢这些行为，那么百姓也能做到，何况兼相爱、交相利与这些行为是不同的。爱别人的人，别人也会爱他；利于别人的人，别人也会利于他；害别人的人，别人也会害他；恶意对待别人的人，别人也会恶意对待他。这有什么难的呢？只是士人不把它当作政治准则，也不把它当作行为准则罢了。”",
        "output": "Mozi said, \"The principle by which a benevolent person handles affairs must be to benefit the world and eliminate harm, using this principle to handle affairs.\" Since this is the case, then what is beneficial to the world, and what is harmful to the world? Mozi said: \"Now, when countries attack each other, families plunder each other, people harm each other, rulers and ministers do not benefit and be loyal to each other, fathers and sons do not love and respect each other, and brothers are not harmonious and united, these are all harmful to the world.\"\n\nSince this is the case, then what are these public hazards caused by? Are they caused by not loving each other? Mozi said: \"They are caused by not loving each other.\" Nowadays, the feudal lords only know how to love their own country and not those of others, so they unscrupulously use their country's power to attack others. The current family patriarchs only know how to love their own family and not others, so they unscrupulously use their family's power to plunder others. People nowadays only know how to love themselves and not others, so they unscrupulously use all their might to harm others. Therefore, when feudal lords do not love each other, they will inevitably engage in warfare; when family patriarchs do not love each other, they will inevitably plunder one another; when people do not love each other, they will inevitably harm one another; when rulers do not love their ministers, they will inevitably fail to benefit and be loyal to each other; when fathers do not love their sons, they will inevitably fail to love and respect each other; when brothers do not love each other, they will inevitably fail to be harmonious and united. When people in the world do not love each other, the strong will inevitably control the weak, the wealthy will inevitably bully the poor, the noble will inevitably look down on the humble, and the cunning will inevitably deceive the foolish. All the disasters, plunder, grievances, and resentments in the world arise because people do not love each other. Therefore, the benevolent consider it wrong.\n\nSince it is considered wrong for people not to love each other, then what should be used to change this? Mozi said: \"Use the method of everyone loving each other and mutually benefiting to change it.\" Since this is so, how should everyone love each other and mutually benefit? Mozi said: \"Treat other people's countries as your own, treat other people's families as your own, and treat other people's bodies as your own.\" Therefore, when feudal lords love each other, they will not engage in warfare; when family patriarchs love each other, they will not plunder each other; when people love each other, they will not harm each other; when rulers and ministers love each other, they will benefit and be loyal to each other; when fathers and sons love each other, they will love and respect each other; when brothers love each other, they will be harmonious and united. When people in the world love each other, the strong will not control the weak, the majority will not force the minority, the wealthy will not bully the poor, the noble will not look down on the humble, and the cunning will not deceive the foolish. All the disasters, plunder, grievances, and resentments in the world can be prevented because people love each other. Therefore, the benevolent praise it.\n\nHowever, the scholars and gentlemen of the world now say: \"Yes, universal love is indeed good. Even so, it is a difficult and roundabout affair in the world.\" Mozi said: \"The scholars and gentlemen of the world only fail to discern the benefits of universal love and the reasons for it. Now, for example, attacking cities and engaging in warfare, or starving oneself to death for the sake of fame, these are all things that the common people of the world find difficult to do. But if the ruler likes it, then the scholars can do it. In comparison, universal love and mutual benefit are entirely different (good things). Those who love others will be loved by others in return; those who benefit others will be benefited by others in return; those who hate others will be hated by others in return; and those who harm others will be harmed by others in return. What is difficult about practicing this universal love? It is only because those in superior positions do not use it in governing, and the scholars do not put it into practice.\" In the past, Jin Wen Gong liked scholars to wear poor clothes, so the scholars under Wen Gong wore sheepskin coats, tied their swords with ox leather, and wore hats made of boiled silk. They could enter the palace or go to court dressed like this. Why was this? Because the ruler liked it, the subjects did so. In the past, King Ling of Chu liked slender waists, so the subjects of Ling Wang ate only one meal a day to diet, held their breath before tying their belts, and leaned against the wall before they could stand up. After a year, the court officials all had dark complexions due to hunger. Why was this? Because the ruler liked it, the subjects could do it. In the past, King Goujian of Yue valued the bravery of his soldiers. When he trained his subjects, he first gathered them together, set fire to the ships, and tested his officers and soldiers by saying, \"The treasures of the State of Yue are all on these ships.\" The King of Yue personally beat the drums to encourage his soldiers to advance. Hearing the drumbeats, the soldiers broke formation and rushed into the fire, and more than a hundred close ministers died. The King of Yue then sounded the retreat. Therefore, Mozi said: \"Eating less, wearing poor clothes, and starving oneself to death for fame are all things that the common people of the world find difficult to do. If the ruler likes it, then the scholars can do it. How much more so for universal love and mutual benefit, which are different from these (good things). Those who love others will be loved by others in return; those who benefit others will be benefited by others in return; those who hate others will be hated by others in return; and those who harm others will be harmed by others in return. What is difficult about this universal love? It is only because those in superior positions do not use it in governing, and the scholars do not put it into practice.\"",

Literati from far and wide, young and old, assembled here. This place is blessed with majestic mountains and lush forests of bamboo; clear streams and rushing rapids flow alongside, providing the setting for our floating wine cups and curving waterways, as we sit in orderly rows. Though we lack a grand ensemble of string and wind instruments, the combination of poetry and wine is enough for us to express our boundless emotions.\n\nOn this day, the sky is clear and the air is fresh, with gentle spring breezes blowing. We gaze upon the vastness of the universe above and contemplate the richness of creation below. Our eyes wander and our thoughts soar, as we indulge in the pleasures of sight and sound, and our hearts are filled with joy.\n\nWhen people come together, they share a bond that spans a lifetime. Some find solace in their own hearts, understanding each other through unspoken words within closed rooms. Others seek to express their feelings by casting off the constraints of their physical selves and embracing a life of carefree wandering. Despite our diverse pursuits and temperaments—some seeking tranquility, others prone to restlessness—when we encounter something that delights us, we momentarily find contentment within ourselves, unaware of the encroaching hands of time. But when we have exhausted our pursuits and our passions begin to wane, our emotions change with the shifting circumstances. We look back on what once brought us joy, now but a distant memory, and still, our hearts stir with emotion. How much more so when we contemplate the fleeting nature of life, the inevitable end that awaits us all? As the ancients said, \"The matter of life and death is indeed a weighty one.\" How sorrowful it is!\n\nWhenever I peruse the writings of those who came before me and delve into the sources of their emotions, I find myself in harmony with their sentiments. I cannot help but sigh with emotion as I read their words, feeling a resonance deep within my heart. I understand that to regard life and death as illusory and to equate longevity with premature death are both foolish notions. Those who come after us will view our present time as we now view the past. Alas, how sorrowful! Therefore, I have compiled a list of the literati present on this occasion, recording their words and sentiments. Though the world may change and circumstances differ, the essence of our emotions remains the same. May those who read these words in the future also find resonance and inspiration in them.",

Many wise and talented men have converged here, and the old and the young are gathered. Lanting is a place with towering peaks, lush and dense forests and bamboo groves; and clear and flowing streams, reflecting and surrounding the pavilion on both sides. We diverted the water to form a ring-shaped channel for floating wine cups, and sat by the winding stream, though without the grandeur of a full orchestra. But drinking and composing poems are enough to freely express the profound and hidden emotions.\n\nOn this day, the weather was clear and the breeze was gentle. Looking up, we surveyed the vast sky, and looking down, we observed the myriad things on the earth, stretching our eyes and broadening our minds, and indulging in the utmost pleasure of sight and sound, which was truly delightful.\n\nPeople interact with each other and soon a lifetime passes. Some talk freely about their aspirations within the confines of a room; some find solace in the things they love, unfettered and unrestrained. Though each has their own pursuits, some seeking tranquility and others reveling in chaos, when they find joy in what they encounter, they feel a sense of contentment and satisfaction, oblivious to the impending aging. But when they grow weary of their beloved pursuits, their emotions change with their circumstances, and sighs ensue. Things once cherished become traces of the past in an instant, evoking sentiments that cannot be ignored, let alone the fleeting nature of life, ultimately culminating in obl. The ancients said, \"Life and death are indeed momentous affairs.\" How can it not grieve people?\n\nWhenever I contemplate the reasons for my predecessors' emotional stirrings, I find them resonating with my own sentiments. I cannot help but sigh with sorrow when facing their writings, though my heart cannot clearly explain why. I know that equating life and death is untrue, and claiming longevity is a fabrication. The way posterity views the present is akin to how the present views the past. Alas! Thus, I record the names of those present and the poems they composed.

Then why can the lotus and its leaves \"emerge from the mud without being sullied\"? It turns out that their outer layers are covered with a waxy substance and are full of papilla-like protrusions. The spaces between the protrusions are filled with air, preventing the intrusion of muddy water. When their leaf and flower buds emerge from the mud, the waxy substance on their surface protects them, making it difficult for the mud to adhere. Even if a small amount of mud attaches to the leaf or flower bud, it is washed away by the rippling water. By the time they emerge above the water surface, they are naturally clean and beautiful.",

        "output": "The terms \"dare not do\" and \"cannot do\" both indicate limitations in action, but they represent different meanings. \n\n\"Dare not do\" usually indicates an unwillingness to take action out of fear or a lack of confidence. In this case, people worry about risks and uncertainties and may experience psychological barriers and obstacles. For example, a person may want to learn a new skill but dare not try due to concerns about their performance or a fear of failure. \n\nIn contrast, \"cannot do\" typically indicates an inability to take action due to objective conditions or constraints. Here, people have a certain awareness of their abilities or resources and thus acknowledge what they cannot do. For instance, an individual may want to take up a job that requires specific skills, but they cannot do so because they lack those skills. \n\n\"Dare not do\" and \" \"cannot do\" are not absolute categories but rather relative states. Sometimes, people may experience both fear and inability towards a certain action, or they may become fearful because they cannot perform a certain task. Therefore, we need to analyze and judge each situation to determine the specific causes and limitations. \n\nUltimately, addressing the issues of \"dare not do\" and \"cannot do\" requires different approaches and strategies depending on the context. If it is due to fear, one can gradually expand their comfort zone and take appropriate actions to boost confidence and courage. If it is due to objective constraints, one can explore alternative paths and methods to achieve their goals. In either case, it is essential to bravely face one's obstacles and actively seek solutions to fulfill one's goals and values.",

This was firmly established through the heroic strategies of Sun Ce and Sun Quan. However, the exceptional talents of that time, such as Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lü Meng, and Lu Xun, were truly the pillars of the country, and their loyalty determined the survival of the state. Throughout history, generals have rarely been humble enough to acknowledge the superiority of others. Yet, these wise men were different. When Sun Quan first took charge, Lu Su wanted to return north, but Zhou Yu stopped him and recommended him to Sun Quan, saying, \"Lu Su's talent is suitable for assisting the times. We should seek more talented individuals like him to achieve greatness.\" Later, as Zhou Yu was nearing his end, he wrote to Sun Quan, \"Lu Su is loyal and courageous, never taking matters lightly. If you choose him to succeed me, my death will not be in vain.\" Thus, Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu in leading the army. Lü Meng served as the magistrate of Xunyang, and when Lu Su met him, he said, \"Your talent and wisdom today far surpass those of the past.\" He then paid respects to Lü Meng's mother, formed a friendship with him, and parted ways. Lü Meng eventually succeeded Lu Su. When Lü Meng was stationed at Lukou, he pretended to be ill and returned, Sun Quan asked, \"Who can replace you?\" Lü Meng replied, \"Lu Xun has a profound mind and the talent to bear great responsibilities. Observing his plans and considerations, he is truly capable of taking on important duties, and there will be no more mistakes.\" So, Lu Xun succeeded Lü Meng. These four men succeeded each other, holding the western frontier for three to four decades, earning reputations as formidable generals. Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Guan Yu were all thwarted by them. Although they recommended each other for their respective roles, Sun Quan entrusted them with all his heart, and this is why Wu became what it was, not by coincidence.",
        "output": "The reason why Sun Wu was able to possess Jiangdong and compete with the Central Plains was fundamentally due to the exceptional talent and grand strategy of Sun Ce and Sun Quan. At that time, among the brilliant talents of Eastern Wu (such as Zhou Yu, Lu Su, Lü Meng, and Lu Xun, who were known as the pillars of the state), there were ministers who were willing to share the fate of the country. However, since ancient times, most generals believed themselves to be virtuous and capable individuals, fearing that others might surpass them. But the virtuous individuals mentioned above were not like that. When Sun Quan had just assumed power, Lu Su (a northerner) wanted to go north to the Jiangbei region (to join Cao Cao). Zhou Yu stopped him and recommended him to Sun Quan, saying, \"Lu Su's talent is suitable for assisting the ruler. We should seek more people like him to accomplish great undertakings.\" Later, when Zhou Yu was on his deathbed, he wrote a letter to Sun Quan, recommending, \"Lu Su is loyal and valiant, and he never takes matters lightly. If you can use him to replace me, I will die without regrets!\" Thus, Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu in leading the army. Lü Meng served as the administrator of Xuning, and Lu Su met him and said, \"Your current talent and wisdom are no longer the same as when you were a young boy in Wu (as Lü Meng had acquired a vast amount of knowledge by then).\" Lu Su then paid respects to Lü Meng's mother, formed a friendship with him, and parted ways. Later, Lü Meng also replaced Lu Su in commanding the army. When Lü Meng was stationed at Lukou and fell ill, he requested to resign, and Sun Quan asked, \"Who can replace you?\" Lü Meng replied, \"Lu Xun has profound wisdom and talent capable of bearing heavy responsibilities. Observing his strategic planning, I believe he can be entrusted with important tasks, and there will be no more mistakes.\" Thus, Lu Xun succeeded Lü Meng. These four individuals took turns leading the region for three to four decades, establishing their formidable reputation as renowned generals. Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Guan Yu were all defeated by them at various times. Although they recommended each other, Sun Quan was also able to listen to them with an open mind.

If you soak the red shells of shrimps and crabs in a chemical called acetone, this pigment will dye the acetone into a beautiful reddish-orange color, and the shells will also fade and turn pale. Later, someone isolated this pigment from lobster eggs, and it was named astaxanthin.\n\nAnimals containing astaxanthin are not only shrimps and crabs, but many crustaceans also use astaxanthin to adorn themselves. Some small-shell animals mainly contain chitosanase, and some crab species contain papilioerythrin. These pigments, including astaxanthin, have a structure similar to carotenoids, and they are widely distributed in nature. The chemical name is ketocarotenoid, and they are the main components of the pigments contained in animals such as \"shrimp and crab generals\".\n\nThe body color of living crustaceans varies due to differences in species and environment, but regardless of the body color of the living \"shrimp and crab generals\", as long as they are soaked in formaldehyde or heated, they will turn red. This is because the pigment protein in the biological body undergoes denaturation when heated, and the pigment originally bound to the protein \"escapes\", revealing the red color.\n\nIn addition, the death of shrimp and crab will also cause the change of protein in the body and the escape of pigment, making the shell turn red.",

During the cooking process, spices such as ginger, scallion, and salt are usually added to enhance the flavor of the chicken.\n\nPoached chicken is typically served with a dipping sauce made of ginger and garlic or soy sauce. In Singapore and Malaysia, poached chicken is often sold as \"Hainanese Chicken Rice\" along with chicken-fat rice, a popular street snack.\n\nThe key to delicious poached chicken lies in the selection of ingredients and the control of cooking temperature. The chicken should be fresh, preferably free-range or native chicken, and the cooking temperature must be just right to ensure that the meat is thoroughly cooked yet remains tender, resulting in a delicate and smooth texture.",

The total print run should be around 40,000 copies by now.\n\nThere are some interesting anecdotes in the book. For instance, why do Chinese people drive on the right side of the road?\n\nIn ancient times, when Chinese people drove carriages, they kept to the left, leaving the right side vacant. This practice was known as \"keeping the left vacant.\" If China's traffic rules had evolved along this line, and if Shanghai's rickshaw pullers had become Ford drivers, they should have been speeding along the left side of the Huangpu River Bund.\n\nHowever, in post-1945 China, the handful of Hummers and Ford cars surprisingly drove on the right side of the road. This practice of \"right-hand drive\" mirrored that of the Americans cruising on the interstate highways across the Great Plains. But why did we follow the American way?\n\nThe story goes back to the Anti-Japanese War. During that war, the relocated Chongqing government received assistance from numerous American soldiers. When the American troops drove in Chongqing, they kept to the right, while the local Chinese aristocrats stuck to the left. Accidents became frequent. Under strong pressure from the American military commander, Chiang Kai-shek issued an order for the entire country to adopt right-hand driving. And that's how we started driving on the right, just like the Americans.",

All of you, please speak your minds.\" The ministers all praised: \"Your Majesty's grace is as vast as the heavens and the earth, beyond what words can describe.\" The emperor said: \"Not so. The reason I have achieved this is solely due to five things. Since ancient times, emperors have often despised those better than themselves. I, however, see the goodness in others as if it were my own. As people cannot be perfect in every aspect, I always discard their shortcomings and embrace their strengths. Emperors often wish to favor the wise by keeping them close or get rid of the unworthy by pushing them away. I, on the other hand, respect the wise and empathize with the unworthy, ensuring that each finds their proper place. Emperors often dislike those who are upright and honest, punishing them in secret or executing them publicly. This has happened in every dynasty, but since I took the throne, upright and honest scholars have filled the court, and not one has been demoted or punished. Since ancient times, emperors have valued the Central Plains but looked down upon the barbarians and nomads. I, however, have loved them equally, and so their tribes have followed me as they would their parents. These five reasons are why I have achieved the success of today.\" Then he turned to Chu Suiliang and asked: \"You have been a historian. Are my words true to the facts?\" Chu replied: \"Your Majesty's virtues are too numerous to be recorded. These five things you mentioned are but a humble expression of your greatness, reflecting your modest spirit.\"",

My talent is not superior to that of the ancient emperors, yet my achievements are greater than theirs. I don't know the reason for this. Please be frank.\" \n\nThe ministers replied, \"Your Majesty's grace is as vast as the heavens and the earth. There is nothing more to say about all other things.\" \n\nTang Taizong said, \"It cannot be said like that. The reason why I have such achievements is that I have only done five things: First, since ancient times, emperors have often been jealous of those who are better than themselves. When I see the strengths of others, I treat them as my own strengths and regard them as my own virtues. Second, everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. I focus on their strengths and overlook their shortcomings. Third, most monarchs want to keep talented people close when they see their good side, but want to push them into the abyss when they see their bad side. However, when I encounter talented and virtuous people, I respect them, and when I encounter those who perform poorly, I educate them from a caring perspective. In this way, both the wise and the unwise find their proper place. Fourth, most monarchs dislike being criticized directly and often secretly harm or openly attack those who speak up. However, since I ascended the throne, there have been many who speak frankly, and not one of them has been dismissed because of their honest opinions. Fifth, traditionally, the Han ethnicity was considered superior, and discrimination against ethnic minorities was common. However, I have always treated everyone equally with care and respect, so the ethnic minorities rely on me as they would their parents. These five points are the reasons for my success today.\"",

His father found this strange, so he borrowed some from a neighbor and gave them to his son. Zhongyong immediately wrote a poem of four lines, even coming up with the title himself. The poem expressed sentiments of filial piety and unity among the clan, and it was passed around the village for all to admire. From then on, he could compose poems about any object he was shown, and his compositions always displayed a remarkable understanding of grammar and logic. The people of the county found this extraordinary, and some of them began to treat his father as an honored guest, or even offered him money. The father, seeing the benefits of this, spent his days bringing Zhongyong around the county to meet people and show off his talent, instead of sending him to school. I had heard of this story long ago. During the Mingdao era, I returned home with my father and saw Zhongyong at my uncle's house. He was twelve or thirteen at the time. I asked him to compose a poem, but it was not as impressive as the ones he wrote when he was younger.

        "output": "I believe many people have had the experience of playing slot machines. Some people gamble in moderation and know when to stop. These people are fortunate. However, many others find themselves unable to resist the lure of the machines and end up losing everything, including their homes and life savings. Some even end up in debt to loan sharks, losing their families and everything they hold dear. So, we must ask, why do people always lose when they play slot machines? In the following paragraphs, I will analyze this problem through mathematics and human nature.\n\nIn theory, the odds of winning and losing on a slot machine are fairly balanced. So, why is it that we always seem to lose? Let's take a common payout ratio of 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 12, 12 as an example. Firstly, the payout ratios are set fairly. It is easy to verify that 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/12 = 1. Secondly, the program is preset, which means that whether you bet 10 or 1,000 credits, the odds of winning remain the same for that particular game. So, where is the problem?\n\nFirstly, we lose because we lack common sense in judgment. While the program may be designed to provide fair odds, it is still created by someone and is not randomly generated. Players often encounter programs like this: a rabbit (with a payout of 6) appears four or five times in a row. What does this mean? The probability of the rabbit appearing once is 1/6, and the theoretical probability of it appearing five times in a row is 1/7776. If we assume that a game takes one minute and there are 60 games played per hour, then in a 24-hour day, this situation should theoretically occur once every 5.4 days. However, in reality, we often encounter it three or four times in a single day, which is clearly illogical. The reason lies in the human factor of the design.\n\nFor example, let's say I decide to bet on an eagle (with a payout of 12). Theoretically, the eagle should appear once every 12 games on average. However, it is entirely possible that it won't appear for 32 consecutive games (about half an hour), and if you keep betting during this time, you could lose all your capital and have no chance to recoup your losses. Let's calculate the theoretical probability of the eagle not appearing for 32 consecutive games: the probability of it not appearing in one game is 11/12, and the probability of it not appearing in 32 games is (11/12)^32, which is approximately 6%. In mathematics, we refer to probabilities smaller than 5% as small probability events, meaning they are almost certain not to occur. In this case, the probability is very close to this threshold, yet this situation occurs frequently in reality.\n\nSecondly, we lose because of our own greed. Many people have had the experience of initially winning when they start playing, but instead of walking away, they continue playing, wanting to win more. They keep playing until they encounter a program like the one mentioned above, and even then, they refuse to accept that they are beat and continue to chase their losses. Eventually, they lose everything, including their original capital and any winnings. After each loss, they tell themselves that next time, they will only win a certain amount and then stop, but how many people can actually do this? If you bring $10,000 and aim to win $1,000, it is relatively achievable, and with persistence, you could still earn $30,000 per month. However, in reality, if you bring $10,000, you likely want to win $10,000, and this excessive greed eventually leads to losing everything.\n\nTherefore, I would like to advise everyone to value their lives and stay away from electronic heroin. It's not too late to turn back now!",

The wavelength of infrared radiation is longer than that of all visible light, so it seems to have a convenient leg that can almost bypass all obstacles on its path and pass through even heavy fog. When an enemy plane flies into our position, an infrared telescope has already received a large amount of infrared radiation emitted by its heat-generating part—the engine. The infrared radiation generates a current in the \"photoelectric converter\" of the telescope, and then the current generates visible light. Thus, the plane in the dark is revealed in the mirror.",

During these movements, hard rocks are subjected to forces that cause them to change shape, sometimes breaking, which is when an earthquake occurs. Although scientists still debate the source of the forces that drive crustal movements and there are many speculations about the fundamental causes of earthquakes, there is no doubt that the direct cause of an earthquake is the breaking of rocks in a particular location. The vast majority of earthquakes occur when new fractures form in underground rocks or when pre-existing cracks slip again. Many strong earthquakes occur where there are fractures underground. When the forces acting on underground rocks approach the point of breakage, the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, and changes in atmospheric or water (reservoir) pressure on the ground, can all contribute to the breakage, potentially triggering an earthquake.\n\nAdditionally, earthquakes often accompany volcanic eruptions. There are many volcanoes on Earth, and each time one erupts, a large amount of scorching magma surges from underground, rapidly expanding in volume and impacting the crust, inevitably causing an earthquake.",

This can be integrated with a smart lock system, allowing keyless entry and enhancing security. \n\n- **Intruder Detection**: AI can analyze data from motion sensors, cameras, and other devices to detect intruders. By learning the patterns of regular activities within the home, AI systems can identify unusual behavior and alert homeowners or authorities. \n\n- **Smart Alarms**: AI-enabled alarms can distinguish between different types of threats, such as fire, gas leaks, or unauthorized access. They can also learn the patterns of a homeowner's daily routine and send alerts if something deviates from the norm, indicating a potential security risk. \n\n- **Data Analytics**: AI can analyze large volumes of data from various sensors and devices within the smart home ecosystem. This data analysis can identify potential vulnerabilities, predict maintenance needs, and optimize the overall security system. \n\n- **Natural Language Processing**: NLP enables AI systems to understand and respond to voice commands, allowing homeowners to control lighting, temperature, and other smart devices using natural language. This enhances convenience and security, especially in situations where manual interaction is not feasible. \n\n- **Behavioral Analytics**: By studying the behavior patterns of occupants, AI can identify potential security risks. For example, if an elderly person's daily routine changes significantly, it could indicate a health issue or the presence of an intruder. AI can detect such anomalies and trigger appropriate responses. \n\nThe applications of AI in smart home security offer enhanced protection, convenience, and peace of mind for homeowners. As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative and effective security solutions in the future.",

These points gather and focus the weak and scattered light from the surroundings, reflecting it back as a concentrated beam. This phenomenon originates from the function of the pupil, which is located in front of the crystalline lens and controls the intensity of light entering the lens, adjusting its size according to the brightness of the external environment. At night, when a cat's pupil dilates to let in more faint light, the converging effect of the crystalline lens and ciliary body, akin to a convex lens, causes the light to concentrate in a small area. Combined with the fact that the photoreceptor cells in the human eye are columnar cells that enhance sensitivity in darkness, the result is the perception of brightness. The bottom of a wolf's eye is endowed with numerous unique crystalline points that possess a strong ability to reflect light. These points can gather and concentrate the weak and scattered light from the surroundings, making it appear as if the wolf's eyes are glowing.",

        "instruction": "Why are there tsunamis?",
        "output": "The source of a tsunami still lies in an earthquake or a volcanic eruption, usually an earthquake, except that they occur underwater. When an earthquake or a volcanic eruption takes place underwater, the enormous energy released will cause a drastic fluctuation of the seawater, forming powerful waves that move forward. Such waves are actually not that impactful when they are far away from the coast. Even ships sailing on the sea will only feel a slight movement. However, once a tsunami enters the continental shelf, it can bring about devastating disasters to the coastal areas.\n\nIn English, the word \"tsunami\" is used for this phenomenon. Interestingly, this is a Japanese word, written in Chinese characters as \"津波\", and it means \"harbor waves\" in Japanese, reflecting the fact that Japan is a country frequently hit by tsunamis.\n\nAlthough volcanic eruptions and other coastal landslides can also trigger tsunamis, generally speaking, they are caused by underwater earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.5 or above, occurring within a depth of 50 kilometers below the seabed. After a strong tremor, a series of oscillation waves will form circles on the sea surface, and as these waves expand, the circles grow bigger and bigger, similar to the effect of dropping a stone into the water. Since the wavelength of a tsunami is larger than the maximum depth of the ocean, these oscillation waves can propagate to very distant places.\n\nThe speed of a tsunami is proportional to the water depth through which it travels. In the Pacific Ocean, this speed typically ranges from a few hundred to over a thousand kilometers per hour. When a tsunami enters the coastal areas, due to the sudden decrease in water depth, the wave height increases drastically, and we can witness towering walls of water that are 20 to 30 meters high. When these walls of water come crashing down, not only small lives but even buildings can be instantly swallowed. Hence, the disasters brought about by tsunamis are often catastrophic. In many places hit by tsunamis, there are usually numerous missing persons, most of whom were swept away in that moment.\n\nThere is a rather peculiar phenomenon before a tsunami strikes: the sea tide suddenly recedes, moving far away from the beach, and it takes some time for the seawater to rise again. Why does this happen? It is because the sudden drop in the sea surface is caused by the arrival of the trough of the tsunami's shockwave. The trough is the lowest part of a wave, and when it reaches a certain point, the sea surface must drop. Additionally, since the tsunami shockwave differs from regular waves, possessing a much longer wavelength, there is a significant time gap between the arrival of the trough and the subsequent peak, and it is during this gap that the wall of water surges forward.\n\nWith this knowledge, people can indeed turn danger into safety before a tsunami strikes. During the tsunami that hit Indonesia, some people lingering on the beach at that time managed to save their lives because they noticed the sudden retreat of the tide and realized the potential danger, prompting them to evacuate promptly.\n\nSimilar to earthquakes, people currently have no means of controlling tsunamis. The best we can do is to enhance awareness and prevention measures in areas prone to such events, thereby minimizing unnecessary loss of life and property.",

The people of Yixing referred to these three menaces as the 'Three Evils', with Zhou Chu being the most aggressive of them all. Someone suggested to Zhou Chu that he kill the tiger and the flood dragon, hoping that by doing so, only one of the 'Three Evils' would remain. Zhou Chu immediately set out to kill the tiger and then entered the water to fight the flood dragon. The flood dragon sometimes submerged and sometimes surfaced, traveling with Zhou Chu for several dozen miles. This battle lasted for three days and three nights, after which the villagers assumed that Zhou Chu had perished, and they rejoiced. However, Zhou Chu emerged victorious over the flood dragon. Upon hearing the villagers' celebration, he realized for the first time that he had been a source of distress for others, and he resolved to mend his ways. He then sought out the two Lu brothers in Wu. While Plain Lu was not there, he met with Clear River Lu, to whom he confessed his past and expressed his desire to reform, lamenting that he had wasted his youth and feared he would amount to nothing. Clear River Lu said, 'The ancients valued those who strove to improve even if it meant death, not to mention that your future is still promising. Besides, one should worry about not having the determination to establish oneself, so why fret about not achieving a good reputation?' Inspired, Zhou Chu changed for the better and ultimately became a loyal subject and filial son.\"",

He then jumped into the water to fight the flood dragon. The flood dragon floated and dived in the water, and the fight drifted dozens of miles away. After three days and three nights, the locals assumed that both the flood dragon and Zhou Chu had perished, and they celebrated. \n\nHowever, Zhou Chu emerged from the shore, carrying the flood dragon's head. When he heard that the locals had celebrated his presumed death, he realized that they also considered him a scourge. He couldn't help but shed tears and felt remorse. \n\nHe then went to Wu County to seek Lu Ji and Lu Yun, two famous scholars of Eastern Wu at the time.

Zhou Chu told him everything and said, \"I want to correct my mistakes, but I have wasted my time, and I'm afraid I won't have any achievements to speak of in the end.\" \n\nLu Yun said, \"The ancients valued morality and believed that 'even if one understands the truth in the morning and dies in the evening, one should be content.'

Why are you doing this?\" Wang Mi replied, \"No one will know at this hour.\" Yang Zhen said, \"Heaven knows, the gods know, I know, and you know. How can you say that no one will know?\" Wang Mi left in shame. Later, Yang Zhen was transferred to Zhuo County as its magistrate. He was naturally upright and frugal, refusing to accept private visits. His descendants often ate vegetarian meals and walked everywhere. Some of his old friends, out of respect for his age, wanted to help set up businesses for his descendants, but Yang Zhen declined, saying, \"Letting our descendants be known as the offspring of a clean official is already a great gift to them.\"",

When the body's resistance weakens, bacteria gain the upper hand, causing inflammation of the tonsils. At this point, we may experience headaches, fever, sore throat, and fatigue. The only way to regain health is to go to the hospital and seek medical help.\n\nIf tonsillitis is not properly treated and recurs, it can lead to rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis.

A disk that is uniformly coated with an extremely thin magnetic material and formatted to specifications can store information. A soft disk is made by coating the magnetic material on a soft plastic film, and a hard disk is made by coating it on a hard aluminum (ceramic or glass) plate.\n\nThe surface of a disk can be a series of dots, and the different polarities of the dots after magnetization represent 0 or 1, respectively. Since the positioning of the dots on the disk surface is usually inaccurate, formats such as sectors are also used to help locate the recording position. This is one of the reasons why a disk needs to be formatted before use. Since the magnetic head used to read and write information can quickly locate any point on the disk, the information on the disk can be accessed directly.",

The simplest would be to \"feel\" hungry, or to have a \"rumbling stomach\", or even to be \"so hungry that one's head spins\". \n\nJörg Häusler, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute of Nutrition, believes that a \"rumbling stomach\" is undoubtedly the clearest signal that you need to eat. \n\nAccording to DPA, Häusler found that when people say they feel hungry because their stomach is empty, it is not actually empty. Instead, there is air and water in the stomach. In this state, the muscles of the stomach move and \"pull\" each other, causing the stomach to form a \"hose-like\" state. \"The air and water in this hose are compressed, which naturally causes the rumbling sound,\" Häusler explained. \n\nScientists believe that the whole process is just a very natural reaction in the human body. In addition, this reaction can also be stimulated or enhanced under certain conditions by other reactions of the human body, such as when delicious food comes into your sight, causing your mouth to start secreting saliva and your stomach to start producing digestive substances such as gastric acid, making you feel hungry, and often your stomach will also start rumbling in time.",

Those who actively exercise their brains tend to have well-stretched brain blood vessels, which provide excellent conditioning for the brain neurons, leading to a more developed brain and preventing premature brain aging. On the contrary, those who are lazy in engaging their brains are more prone to premature brain aging due to the lack of stimulation from information input.\n\nBy observing a certain number of individuals aged 20 to 70, scientists found that those who have been engaged in intellectual labor for a long time could still maintain agile thinking abilities at the age of 60. In contrast, among those lazy individuals who do nothing all day and just get by, the proportion of people with premature brain aging is significantly higher than those who actively use their brains.",

As the breeding season comes to an end, this behavior of displaying the tail feathers will gradually disappear. Additionally, both female peacocks and young peacocks will also spread their tails as a defensive or warning gesture against potential threats. This is similar to how a mother hen will fluff up her feathers and flap her wings to protect her chicks when they are attacked by an eagle.\n\nWhen peacocks spread their tails in front of tourists dressed in colorful clothing, it is not a matter of \"competing in beauty\", but rather a reaction to the loud noises made by the tourists, which stimulates the peacocks and triggers their warning response.

It is a broad term that encompasses various musical styles such as salsa, merengue, bachata, and reggaeton. Latin music is known for its vibrant rhythms, passionate vocals, and instrumental diversity.\n\nIn Mexico, Latin music has a strong presence and has developed its own unique characteristics over time. Mexican Latin music is heavily influenced by the country's rich cultural heritage, including indigenous, Spanish, and African traditions. Here are some characteristics of Latin music in Mexico:\n\n1. Mariachi: Mariachi is arguably the most iconic form of Mexican Latin music. It is a traditional style that originated in the state of Jalisco and is characterized by the use of trumpets, violins, and guitars. Mariachi bands typically consist of at least four members, wearing charro suits and wide-brimmed hats. The music is often lively and festive, with songs about love, patriotism, and revolutionary themes.\n\n2. Son Jarocho: Son Jarocho is a folk music genre from the Mexican state of Veracruz. It is a fusion of Spanish, Indigenous, and African musical elements, and it is closely associated with the zapateado dance style. Son Jarocho is played with a variety of instruments, including the jarana jarocha (a small guitar), the requinto jarocho (a small guitar-like instrument), and the arpa jarocha (a harp). The lyrics often reflect themes of love, nature, and social issues.\n\n3Multiplier. Cumbia: Cumbia is a popular dance music genre that has its roots in Colombia but has also been adopted and adapted by Mexico. Mexican Cumbia incorporates indigenous and Spanish influences and is known for its catchy rhythms and sensual dance moves. It is often played at parties, clubs, and social gatherings.\n\n4. Bolero: Bolero is a romantic music genre that originated in Cuba and gained popularity across Latin America, including Mexico. Mexican boleros are often characterized by heartfelt lyrics and slow, sentimental rhythms. They are typically performed by a trio of musicians, known as \"trios romanticos,\" consisting of a guitarist, a vocalist, and a percussionist.\n\n5. Regional Variations: Mexico is a large country with diverse regional cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its music as well. Latin music in Mexico varies across regions, incorporating local traditions and influences. For example, the music of the northern border region is heavily influenced by the proximity to the United States and may include styles like Norteño and Banda, while the music of the southern states, such as Oaxaca and Chiapas, may showcase indigenous influences more prominently.",

However, humans do not have the heaviest brains either. The brains of whales and elephants, for instance, are several times heavier than those of humans, yet their intelligence falls short of human capabilities. Anthropologists from the former Soviet Union devised an index to indicate the level of brain development, with a larger index denoting a more developed brain. Measurements have shown that the human brain index far surpasses that of all other animals. Of course, this does not imply that a larger brain is always smarter.\n\nIn fact, the human brain has numerous gyri and sulci that increase the surface area of the cerebral cortex, thereby increasing the number of cortical neurons. So, a smaller head does not necessarily mean fewer brain cells, nor does a larger head guarantee more brain cells.

The new type of MCMV, however, is designed for both mine detection and neutralization. As MCMVs can only neutralize mines individually, their usage is limited. Nevertheless, they have reduced the blind sweep in mine-sweeping operations and changed the passive situation in anti-mine battles. A meticulous search plan must be formulated before mine hunting. \n\nThe operational speed should ensure that the sonar has a good detection effect. After underwater targets are detected, identification sonars are used to identify them. Once a mine is confirmed, a neutralizer is released to deploy an explosive device to destroy the mine. Excluding the search process, it generally takes about half an hour from the release of the neutralizer, the neutralization of the mine, to the retrieval of the neutralizer. When conducting fleet mine hunting, a single horizontal formation is usually adopted, with a certain overlap in the sonar search range of each ship to ensure that no mines are missed.",

This is completely unscientific. So, what is the function of the gallbladder?\n\nFirst of all, it can store bile. When digestion requires it, the bile stored in the gallbladder is discharged from the gallbladder. In addition, the gallbladder can concentrate bile. Most of the water and electrolytes in the yellow alkaline liver bile are absorbed by the gallbladder mucosa and returned to the blood, leaving the effective components of the bile stored in the gallbladder. Moreover, the gallbladder can also secrete mucus to protect the biliary mucosa from erosion and dissolution by concentrated bile. Most importantly, 3-5 hours after a meal, food passes through the duodenum and stimulates the duodenal mucosa to produce a hormone called cholecystokinin, which causes the gallbladder to contract and discharge the bile into the duodenum to aid in the digestion and absorption of fat.\n\nIt can be seen that the most important task of the gallbladder is to aid digestion, and it has nothing to do with the size of one's courage.",

        "instruction": "Legend: Mary's son by Darnley, James, was born at Edinburgh Castle on 19 June 1566, but Rizzio's murder inevitably led to the breakdown of her marriage. In October 1566, Mary was staying at Jedburgh, on the Scottish borders, from where she rode on a journey of at least four hours to visit Bothwell, the Earl of Hertford, at Hermitage Castle, where he lay injured from a skirmish with the borderers. Mary's enemies later used this ride as evidence that the two were lovers, even though there was no suspicion at the time and Mary was accompanied by her councillors and guards. On her return to Jedburgh, she immediately fell ill with a severe illness, including frequent vomiting, loss of vision, loss of speech, convulsions, and fainting. She was thought to be close to death. Her recovery, which began on 25 October, was attributed to the skill of her French doctors. The cause of her illness is unclear; diagnoses included physical exhaustion and emotional strain, a gastric haemorrhage, and poisoning. At the end of November 1566, Mary and leading nobles met at Craigmillar Castle, near Edinburgh, to discuss 'the Darnley question'. They spoke of divorce, but the nobles present may also have sworn to remove Darnley by other means: 'It was thought convenient and most expedient for the commonwealth... that such a young, innocent, and proud tyrant should not reign or rule over them;... that he should be put off by one way or another; whosoever would take the deed in hand or do it, they would defend.' Darnley, fearing for his safety, went to Glasgow shortly before Christmas, staying at his father's estate, after his son was baptised at Stirling. At the start of the journey, he fell ill with a fever, possibly smallpox or measles, or the result of poison, and was sick for several weeks. In late January 1567, Mary induced her husband to return to Edinburgh. He recovered from his illness at the house of Sir James Balfour...\n\nQuestion: When did Mary go to visit her husband?",

This goes against the best common interest but is in their own individual best interest. However, in reality, law enforcement agencies are unlikely to create such a scenario to induce all prisoners to confess, because the prisoners must consider factors other than the sentence (such as the possibility of retaliation for betraying an accomplice), and thus cannot solely base their decision on the benefit set forth by the law enforcement (the sentence).",

When he was in Xilo, he once told his colleagues, 'In my life, I have only one passion, and that is reading. When I sit, I read classics and histories; when I lie down, I read fiction; and even when I'm in the toilet, I browse through small-print texts. Indeed, there is hardly a moment when I am not immersed in a book.' \n\nXie Xishen also remarked, 'When Song Gongcui and I were in the Historical Institute, he would always take a book with him whenever he went to the toilet. The sound of his recitation was clear and loud, echoing through the halls and reaching far and wide. Such was his dedication to his studies.' \n\nI then said to Xishen, 'Much of my writing has been done in the three 'up' positions: on horseback, on my pillow, and in the toilet. Indeed, these are the times when thoughts flow most freely.'\"",

When he was in West Capital Luoyang, he once told his bureaucratic subordinates: 'In life, my only hobby is reading. I read the classics (i.e., the works of pre-Qin hundred schools of thought) and historical books while sitting, and when I lie down, I read all sorts of miscellaneous notes. Even when I'm in the toilet, I read small phrases. I probably have never put down a book for a moment.' Xie Jiang once said: 'When I lived with Song GongChui in the Shi Yuan, he would always bring a book with him whenever he went to the toilet. The sound of his reading was clear and loud, audible near and far. His love for learning has reached such a degree.' Because of this, I told Xie Jiang: 'Most of the articles I wrote in my life were written in the 'three places': on horseback, on my pillow, and in the toilet. It seems that only in such places can I think calmly.\"",

Your Majesty, if there is something the people greatly desire, you should do it first; if there is something the people greatly detest, you should remove it first. In history, there has never been a case where one desires and detests the same things as the people, yet fails to earn their support. Before order can be established, one must first understand the root of chaos, which lies in the hearts of the people. Especially during times of upheaval and uncertainty, when people's loyalties are wavering, where the people stand, there stands the majority.

How much more so at a time of change and upheaval, when the hearts of the people are shaken, and we are at a critical juncture of danger and doubt, with the people's loyalty hanging in the balance! When the people's hearts turn towards the ruler, everything will flourish; when the people's hearts are estranged, everything will be in peril.

Building an embankment with a wider base and a narrower top is an adaptation to the changing water pressure while saving materials. Since the gravity of an embankment is vertical, it will produce a resultant force with the horizontal thrust of the waves. If the resultant force exceeds the base of the embankment, the embankment will collapse. Building an embankment with a wider base and a narrower top prevents the resultant force from exceeding the base, thus making the embankment more stable. In addition, building an embankment with a slope can prevent the soil from collapsing. The smaller carrying weight per unit area at the base of the embankment due to its wider shape reduces the burden on the embankment foundation, making the dam more secure.",

Water has a relaxing and softening effect on tissues.\n\nResearch shows that the skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet is the thickest and has a protective effect on the hands and feet, which is why it is most prone to wrinkling. In fact, our skin is covered with a thin layer of oil that prevents it from absorbing water directly from the outside. However, when we soak in warm or hot water for about half an hour, this layer of oil is removed by the warm water, causing the skin to start absorbing water. The surface of our skin is a layer called the \"epidermis\", and below the epidermis is the \"dermis\". The epidermis and dermis are not completely tightly \"glued\" together; the epidermis is tightly \"bound\" to the dermis only in certain areas, while in other areas it is not. Therefore, when the epidermis absorbs water and becomes \"swollen\", the places that are \"bound\" become restricted and appear sunken. From the outside, the surface of the skin appears uneven, with wrinkles.\n\nThe epidermis is made up of tough, dead cells. Under a microscope, these cells resemble the shape of paving stones. Generally speaking, the epidermis is very thin, about 0.01 millimeters, but the epidermis on the palms and soles of the feet can reach or exceed 0.5 millimeters in thickness, which is why wrinkles are particularly noticeable in these areas. In theory, swimming or taking a bath can also cause the skin on the chest and abdomen to wrinkle, but since these areas have almost no expandable stratum corneum, only minor wrinkles appear.\n\nIn the past, some women specifically worked as washers, and their hands were constantly soaked in water, resulting in constantly wrinkled fingers, a kind of occupational \"ailment\" (or rather, characteristic). In ancient times, washerwomen were called \"piaomu\", so this finger phenomenon was also called \"piaomu skin\".",

Centuries ago, the Greeks and Persians had been waging wars for several centuries. Persian priests, known as \"magosh\" in Persian and later as \"magoi\" in Greek, performed ritualistic acts called \"mageia,\" then \"magika,\" which eventually referred to any foreign, unorthodox, or illegal ritual practices. By the 17th century, many books described magic tricks. Before the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs. One of the founders of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, who opened a magic theater in Paris in 1845. John Henry Anderson brought about the same transformation in London in the 1840s. In the late 19th century, it became common to have large-scale magic shows permanently staged in big theaters. As an entertainment form, magic easily made the transition from theater stages to magic shows on television. \n\nQuestion: What is the origin of magic? \n\nAnswer: Magic has its roots in ancient rituals performed by Persian priests, which later evolved into a performing art that entertained people for centuries. The term \"magic\" itself is derived from the Greek language, reflecting the influence of ancient Greek and Persian cultures on the early concepts of magic.",

In 1956, a secret committee for the military application of atomic energy was established, and a carrier development program was initiated. In 1957, shortly after the Suez Canal crisis and diplomatic tensions with the Soviet Union and the United States, French President René Coty decided to establish the C.S.E.M., a new nuclear testing facility in what was then the French Sahara desert, replacing the test facility of the (CIEES).\" \n\nTranslation: \n\nThe paragraph outlines significant developments in France's nuclear program during the post-war period. Initially, nuclear research faced interruptions due to instability and financial constraints under the Fourth Republic. However, the 1950s marked a turning point with the initiation of a civilian nuclear research program, which also intended to produce plutonium as a byproduct. The establishment of a secret committee for military atomic energy applications and the launch of a carrier development program further emphasized the country's commitment to nuclear capabilities. Soon after navigating through the Suez Canal crisis and diplomatic tensions with global superpowers, President René Coty approved the creation of the C.S.E.M., a cutting-edge nuclear testing facility in the French Sahara, superseding the previous test site associated with the (CIEES).",

Each bottle of Maotai undergoes an aging process of at least five years to achieve its optimal taste.\n\nMaotai has a rich and layered flavor profile, characterized by a unique blend of wheat, fruit, and floral aromas. It is mellow, sweet, and full-bodied, with a long-lasting aftertaste. Maotai is hailed as the \"National Liquor\" of China, enjoying an extremely high reputation within the country. It is also the designated liquor served by the Chinese government when hosting foreign dignitaries on important occasions.\n\nIn addition to the traditional Maotai, the company produces various other types of spirits, such as Feitian Maotai and Wuxing Maotai.

It is a migratory bird species with a remarkable ability to undertake long-distance migrations. These birds are easily recognizable by their distinctive reddish-brown plumage during breeding season, which gives them their common name. They have a long, slender bill, adapted for probing in mud and sand for food. Their scientific name, Calidris canutus, derives from the Latin words \"calidris\", meaning \"sand lapper\", and \"canutus\", referring to the species' association with coastal habitats. \n\nContinuing on from the previous question, here is a paragraph containing the answer: \n\nThe Red-Knot Calidris canutus is an incredible species of shorebird, renowned for its impressive migratory journeys. Belonging to the family Scolopacidae, this bird is a true nomad, traveling vast distances between its breeding and wintering grounds. During the breeding season, their plumage takes on a stunning reddish-brown hue, a feature that inspired their common name. With long, slender bills, they are adept at foraging in muddy and sandy environments, probing for small invertebrates and other food sources. The scientific name, Calidris canutus, is a reflection of their habitat and feeding behavior, derived from Latin terms relating to their sand-lapping habits and coastal preference. These birds are a testament to the wonders of nature, showcasing remarkable adaptations that enable them to navigate the challenges of long-distance travel. Their migration is a carefully choreographed dance, a testament to their resilience and innate navigational skills. The Red Knots embody the beauty of nature's design, offering a fascinating insight into the world of avian migration.",

They threatened him with a dagger, but he still would not obey and ended up having his right thumb cut off and sent away. Fortunately, Zhao Guang had been using his left hand for his entire life.

During the Jianyan era, he fell into the hands of the Jin troops. Upon learning of his talent in painting, the Jin soldiers asked him to paint portraits of captive women. Zhao Guang resolutely refused, and when the soldiers tried to coerce him with knives, he remained unyielding. As a consequence, his right thumb was chopped off. However, Zhao Guang was actually left-handed. After the situation calmed down, Zhao Guang only painted images of Guanyin Bodhisattva. Several years later, Zhao Guang passed away.

Determining direction using tree rings\n\nIn northern China, many tree trunks display distinct tree rings. The rings on the south-facing side are usually sparser, while those on the north-facing side tend to be denser. Generally, the rings on the trunk's cross-section are more spaced out on the southern side and closer together on the northern side.\n\n3. Determining direction using moss on stones or roots\n\nMoss prefers to grow in moist and shaded areas. By identifying the presence of moss, one can locate the shaded side, which helps determine the sun-facing south direction.\n\n4. Determining direction using the sun\n\nThe direction where the sun rises is east. Facing the sun, the front is east, the back is west, the left is north, and the right is south.",

Typically, a higher current ratio indicates that a company is more capable of meeting its short-term liabilities and thus has stronger liquidity and solvency. The current ratio is usually calculated as follows:\n\nCurrent Ratio = (Current Assets) / (Current Liabilities)\n\nDifferent companies may have different target current ratios, so the ratio by itself does not necessarily indicate whether a situation is good or bad. However, generally, a higher current ratio is preferable as it suggests that a company is more capable of meeting its short-term liabilities. Nevertheless, an excessively high current ratio may imply that a company is not utilizing its assets efficiently and could be missing out on investment opportunities.",

Thus, as you walk in the darkness, the moon stays within your field of vision for the longest time, giving you the impression that it is following your every step.\n\nIn reality, the moon does not follow us. We get this impression for two reasons: firstly, the moon is a massive celestial body far away from us, and there are rarely any objects nearby that can block its shine. It is not that the moon is following us, but rather that no matter where we go, we cannot seem to get out of its range. Secondly, it is an illusion caused by relative motion. For example, when we sit on a moving train, we feel that the trees and fields on both sides are moving, when in fact it is only the train that is in motion. It is the same with the moon \"following\" us—it is not the moon that is moving, but us. However, the distance we cover is minuscule compared to the distance between the Earth and the moon, which is 380,000 kilometers.\n\nWhen we look up at the moon in the sky, it appears to stay in a fixed position. As we walk, we cover a certain distance, but from the Earth's perspective, this distance is negligible, and the change in the angle of view is also insignificant for the moon. This means that walking barely changes your relative position to the moon, giving the impression that the moon is following your movements.",

When determining custody, the court will take into comprehensive consideration factors such as the child's current living conditions, the work and income of both spouses, their moral character, and whether the child has been primarily raised by one parent. In China, according to the laws and relevant judicial interpretations on marriage and family, the following principles are mainly followed in establishing direct custody of minor children:\n1. The principle of prioritizing the physical and mental health of the child and protecting their lawful rights and interests;\n2. For children who are still breastfeeding, the principle is that they should be raised by the breastfeeding mother;\n3. For children who have been weaned, the principle is that both parties should first try to reach an agreement through consultation. If an agreement cannot be reached, the court will make a judgment based on the child's best interests and the specific circumstances of both parties;\n4. In the case of a dispute over whether a minor child over ten years old should live with the father or the mother, the principle is to give appropriate consideration to the opinion of the minor child. The party who does not raise the child should pay child support, which is generally 20-30% of the income of the non-custodial parent. Child support includes living expenses, education fees, medical expenses, etc. The specific amount of child support should be determined based on the local living standards and the child's possible actual living expenses.\n\nArticle 1084 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China: The relationship between parents and children shall not be eliminated due to the parents' divorce. After the divorce, regardless of whether the child is directly raised by the father or the mother, the child is still the child of both parents.\n\nAfter the divorce, parents still have the rights and obligations to raise, educate, and protect the children.\n\nAfter the divorce, for children under the age of two, the principle is that they should be directly raised by the mother. For children who are two years old and above, if the parents cannot reach an agreement on custody, the People's Court shall make a judgment based on the specific circumstances of both parties and according to the principle of the best interests of the minor child. For children who are over eight years old, their genuine wishes shall be respected.",

Lu Zhi then submitted a memorial to the emperor, which said in summary: 'I believe that the most urgent task at present lies in examining the sentiments of the people. Your Majesty, if there is something the people strongly desire, you should do it first; if there is something they strongly detest, you should remove it first. Throughout history, there has never been a case where someone desires and detests the same things as the people yet fails to gain their support. The root of chaos lies in the people's hearts. During times of upheaval and uncertainty, when people's loyalty is wavering, those who gain the people's support will stand, and those who lose it will fall.

This is indeed the most pressing issue of the day.'\"",

If there is something that the people like very much, Your Majesty should implement it first; if there is something that the people detest, Your Majesty should get rid of it first. Your Majesty's likes and dislikes are the same as those of the people of the world, and there has never been a case in history where the people are unwilling to turn to Your Majesty.

How much more so at a time of change and upheaval, when the hearts of the people are shaking, and we are at a critical juncture of danger and doubt, with the people's allegiance hanging in the balance! When the people's hearts turn towards the ruler, everything will flourish; when they are estranged, everything will be in peril. How can Your Majesty not scrutinize the aspirations of the people, share their likes and dislikes, and inspire their loyalty and devotion to stabilize the nation?

People would even say, 'I would rather be punished by the law than be looked down upon by Mr. Chen.' During a time of famine and poverty, a thief broke into his house one night and hid on the beam. Shi, who had noticed the intruder, got up, straightened his clothes, called for his children and grandchildren, and sternly taught them: 'One must strive to improve oneself. A person who does wrong may not be inherently evil, but their habits and nature can lead them astray. The gentleman hiding on the beam is a reminder of this!' The thief was shocked and threw himself on the ground, confessing his wrongdoing. Shi calmly explained, 'From your appearance, you do not seem like an evil person. You should reflect and strive to do good. However, your actions may be driven by poverty.' He then ordered that two bolts of silk be given to the thief.

There was a thief who entered Chen Shi's house at night and hid on the rafter. Chen Shi secretly discovered this, so he got up and straightened his clothes, calling his children and grandchildren together, and admonishing them sternly: \"One cannot help but strive to improve oneself. A person who is not virtuous is not necessarily bad by nature, but bad habits are often formed by a lack of attention to one's moral cultivation, and thus one ends up in such a state. The gentleman on the beam is such a person!\" The thief was startled and jumped down from the rafter to kneel on the ground, confessing sincerely. Chen Shi slowly said to him, \"Looking at your appearance, you don't seem like a bad person either. You should restrain yourself and return to the right path. However, your actions are probably due to poverty.\" In the end, he also gave the thief two bolts of silk. From then on, there were no more thefts in the entire county.",

After Liu Tingshi passed the imperial examination, his fiancée fell ill and lost her eyesight. Coming from a humble farming family, the girl's family was too poor to mention the marriage again. When someone suggested that he marry the girl's younger sister, Liu Tingshi smiled and said, \"My heart is already promised to her. Even though she has lost her sight, how can I go back on my initial intention?\" Eventually, he married the blind girl and lived with her until they grew old.",

These points gather and focus the weak and scattered light from the surroundings, reflecting it as a concentrated beam. \n\nThis phenomenon can be explained by understanding the function of the pupil, which is located in front of the crystalline lens and controls the intensity of light entering it. The size of the pupil adjusts according to the external light conditions; at night, when a cat's pupil dilates to let in more faint light, the converging effect of the crystalline lens and ciliary body (acting as a convex lens) focuses the light into a small area. This, combined with the increased sensitivity of the rod cells in the human eye during darkness, results in the perception of brightness. The bottom of a wolf's eye contains many of these special crystalline points, which have a strong ability to reflect light. They gather the weak and scattered light from the surroundings, focusing it into a beam that is reflected out in a concentrated manner, creating the illusion of the wolf's eyes glowing.",

This equates to around 6% of the world's population. Diabetes is prevalent in both developed and developing countries. However, it remains uncommon in the least developed nations. The disease appears to disproportionately affect women and certain ethnic groups, such as South Asians, Pacific Islanders, Latinos, and Native Americans. This may be due to increased susceptibility to Western lifestyles among certain populations. Traditionally considered an adult disease, type 2 diabetes is increasingly being diagnosed in children as obesity rates rise. In the United States, the frequency of type 2 diabetes diagnosis among adolescents is similar to that of type 1 diabetes. The estimated number of people with diabetes was 30 million in 1985, increasing to 135 million in 1995 and 217 million in 2005. This growth is mainly attributed to aging populations, decreasing physical activity, and rising obesity rates worldwide. As of 2000, the top five countries with the highest number of diabetes patients were India (31.7 million), China (20.8 million), the United States (17.7 million), Indonesia (8.4 million), and Japan (6.8 million). The World Health Organization has recognized it as a global epidemic.\n\nQuestion: How many people in the world have type 2 diabetes?\n\nAnswer: Approximately 392 million people worldwide were living with type 2 diabetes as of 2015, comprising around 90% of all diabetes cases. This number is expected to have grown since then due to ongoing trends in aging populations, sedentary lifestyles, and increasing obesity rates globally. Diabetes is a significant health concern that affects a substantial portion of the world's population, and its prevalence varies across different regions and demographic groups.",

From then on, he was given specific items to compose poems about, and he would promptly write them with both literary flair and meaningful content. The people in the same county were amazed by his talent and gradually treated his father as an honored guest. Some even paid money to have Zhongyong write poems for them.

When He heard that Xin had escaped, he did not dare to report it and set off in pursuit of Xin. Someone told the King, 'Chancellor Xiao He has escaped.' The King was extremely angry, as if he had lost his right and left hands. After a day or two, He came to see the King, who was both angry and pleased. He scolded He, 'Why did you escape?' He replied, 'Your subject would not dare to escape. Your subject was pursuing the escaped person.' The King asked, 'Whom were you pursuing?' He replied, 'Han Xin.' The King scolded again, 'Several generals have escaped, and you did not pursue them. Pursuing Xin is deceitful.' He said, 'The other generals are easy to find. As for Xin, he is a peerless talent in the nation. If you, King, want to be the King of Hanzhong for a long time, you need not employ Xin. If you want to compete for the world, there is no one but Xin with whom you can plan. It depends on what strategy Your Majesty chooses.'\"",

When Xiao He heard that Han Xin had run away, he did not have time to report the matter to Han Wang and went off in pursuit. Someone who did not know the full story reported to Han Wang, \"Chancellor Xiao He has run away.\" Han Wang was extremely angry, as if he had lost his right and left hands. After a day or two, Xiao He returned to see Han Wang, who was both angry and pleased. He scolded Xiao He, \"Why did you run away?\" Xiao He replied, \"I dare not run away. I was chasing after the person who ran away.\" Han Wang asked, \"Who did you go to chase back?\" Xiao He said, \"Han Xin.\" Han Wang scolded him again, \"Dozens of officers have run away, and you didn't chase after any of them. Instead, you went after Han Xin. This is a lie.\" Xiao He said, \"Those officers are easy to come by, but a talent like Han Xin is one that the whole world cannot find a second of. If Your Majesty only wants to remain as the King of Hanzhong, then you will not need him. But if you want to contend for the world, then apart from Han Xin, there is no one else you can discuss grand plans with. It all depends on what Your Majesty intends to do.\"",

        "output": "Many parents of children with facial paralysis reflect that their children have always been quite healthy, so how did they suddenly develop facial paralysis? In fact, the triggers for facial paralysis are often invisible and are not the result of external injuries or other tangible factors as we understand them. Viral infections are the most common cause of pediatric facial paralysis, followed by exposure to cold temperatures, meaning that facial paralysis often occurs without any warning signs.\n\nFirst, common causes:\nThere are many reasons why children develop facial paralysis, including viral infections, exposure to cold, etc. Viral infections are the most important trigger among them. Most children with facial paralysis will have a history of viral infections such as the cold or pharyngitis before the onset of the condition. Some children also develop facial paralysis due to inflammation of the tympanic membrane in the mastoid foramen behind the ear, which compresses the facial nerve and causes functional impairment due to insufficient blood supply. Therefore, parents should pay attention to keeping their children warm and protected from the cold.\n\nSecond, inappropriate treatment:\nIn fact, inappropriate treatment is also a cause of pediatric facial paralysis. This reason is not a triggering factor but an aggravating one. After the onset of facial paralysis, many parents do not discover it in time, or they may believe in some traditional remedies, failing to seek timely medical treatment, thus missing the best treatment window and leaving their children with permanent regrets. Early treatment for facial paralysis is relatively simple, so parents should aim for early detection and treatment of their children's condition.\n\nThird, standardized treatment:\nThe treatment of facial paralysis often requires a relatively long process, and it generally takes one or two months of treatment for children to gradually recover. During treatment, parents should take their children to a regular hospital for standardized treatment under the guidance of a neurologist. Drug and injection therapies can be used, and acupuncture and physical therapy can also be accepted. Whether the treatment is timely or not directly affects the prognosis, so parents should pay attention to this aspect.\n\nIn addition to understanding the causes of pediatric facial paralysis, parents should also be aware of its hazards and related treatment methods. If facial paralysis is not treated correctly, it can easily lead to sequelae, affecting the child's future life and work.",

When the people are wealthy, they value their communities and families, leading to respect for authority and fear of transgressing the law, making them easier to govern. Conversely, when the people are poor, they disregard their communities and families, emboldening them to defy authority and break the rules, making governance challenging. Thus, nations that are well-governed are often prosperous, while those in chaos are usually impoverished. Hence, a wise leader will always seek to enrich the people before attempting to govern them.\"",

Why is this so? When the people are rich, they are content to live in their hometowns and cherish their homes. When they are content and cherish their homes, they will respect their rulers and fear the law. When the people are poor, they become discontent with their hometowns and disregard their homes. This discontent and disregard lead to daring to challenge their rulers and violate the prohibitions. When the people challenge their rulers and break the rules, the country becomes difficult to govern. Therefore, countries that are well-governed are often rich, while chaotic countries are inevitably poor. Hence, a monarch who excels in governing a country must first enrich the people and only then proceed to govern them.",

In the summer, hollow glass can block 90% of sunlight, and the light transmitted through the glass will not cause a sense of heat. Additionally, hollow glass helps reduce the self-weight of a building.",

        "output": "Ice clouds are composed of tiny ice crystals. When these small ice crystals collide with each other, the surfaces of the ice crystals heat up and melt slightly, and they stick together and refreeze. This process repeats many times, causing the ice crystals to grow larger. In addition, there is also water vapor within the cloud, so the ice crystals can continue to grow through deposition. However, ice clouds are usually very high and not thick, and there is not much water vapor there. The growth through deposition is slow, and the chances of collisions are also low, so they cannot grow large enough to form precipitation. Even if they do cause precipitation, it is often evaporated on the way down and rarely reaches the ground.\n\nThe most favorable type of cloud for droplet growth is the mixed cloud. Mixed clouds are composed of small ice crystals and supercooled water droplets. When a pocket of air has become saturated for ice crystals, it is not yet saturated for water droplets. At this time, the water vapor in the cloud undergoes deposition onto the surfaces of the ice crystals, while the supercooled water droplets evaporate, creating a phenomenon where the ice crystals \"absorb\" water vapor from the supercooled droplets. Under these conditions, the ice crystals grow rapidly. Additionally, supercooled water is very unstable. As soon as it is disturbed, it will freeze. Therefore, within a mixed cloud, when supercooled water droplets collide with ice crystals, they will freeze and adhere to the surfaces of the ice crystals, causing them to rapidly increase in size. When these enlarged ice crystals grow large enough to overcome the resistance and buoyancy of the air, they fall to the ground as snowflakes.",

Among birds with wings, some can fly very high, fast, and far, while others can only manage short hops, glides, or are even completely incapable of flight. This goes to show that there is a lot to learn just from their wings.\n\nThe complexity of a bird's wing structure is no less than that of the bird itself. If the feather arrangement of a bird's wing skillfully applies aerodynamics, then when the wings flap up and down or move in a pressing motion, they can push against the air and utilize the principle of reaction to propel forward in flight. A well-structured arrangement of feathers can effectively reduce air resistance encountered during flight, and some can even help to eliminate vibration and noise. The wings of different bird species vary greatly, and this variation alone has produced many excellent and average \"pilots.\"",

Damaging the leaves will cause the plant to redirect more nutrients to root growth.

In other words, tiny objects can fall at a very slow speed in the air, which is why ants fall at a small speed and do not die from the fall.\n\nWe can conceive of a way to make an ant fall to its death: place the ant in a long glass tube that is evacuated of air. When the ant falls in such a tube, due to the absence of air resistance, if the tube is long enough, the ant may indeed fall to its death.",

        "output": "During winter, many places in our country are often hit by cold surges. A cold surge is a strong, cold, and dry airflow that moves from the north to the south. When its front edge comes into contact with the warm and humid air in the south, the warm air will be pushed upwards because cold air is denser than warm air. This causes the water vapor in the warm air to quickly condense and freeze into ice crystals, which then grow into snowflakes and fall to the ground.\n\nBefore a cold surge arrives, the warm and humid airflow in the south is usually active, so the temperature may rise slightly. Additionally, the condensation and freezing of water vapor into snowflakes release a certain amount of heat, which makes the temperature not too cold before and during snowfall.\n\nAfter the center of the cold surge has passed, the clouds disperse and the snowfall stops, and the weather immediately becomes clear. Without the cloud cover, the ground starts to radiate a large amount of heat outward, causing the temperature to drop significantly. Moreover, the snow melts under the sunlight, absorbing a large amount of heat in the process. According to experiments, 1 gram of ice at 0°C absorbs 334.4 joules (80 calories) of heat to melt into 0°C water. Therefore, when a large area of snow melts, a considerable amount of heat is absorbed, making people feel a drop in temperature.",

He advised the emperor to bridge this gap by heeding the advice of his subjects and accepting their petitions. Lu Zhi then submitted a memorial to the emperor, which said in part: 'I believe that the most urgent task at present is to examine the sentiments of the people. Your Majesty should first do what the people most desire and refrain from doing what they most detest. Throughout history, there has never been a case where someone was able to rule the world without aligning their desires and aversions with those of the people. The root of chaos lies in the hearts of the people. This is especially true during times of upheaval and uncertainty, when people's loyalties are easily swayed. Your Majesty, how can you not examine the sentiments of the people, align your desires and aversions with theirs, and unite the masses to bring peace to the nation? This is indeed the most pressing matter of the day.'\"",
        "output": "Dezong asked Lu Zhi about the most urgent affairs of the day. Lu Zhi thought that the reason for the past disturbances was that the feelings between the upper and lower levels were not communicated. He advised Dezong to be in touch with the lower levels and to listen to advice and criticism. So he submitted a memorial, which said in general: \"I think the most urgent affair at present lies in understanding the hearts of the people in detail. If it is something that the people like very much, then Your Majesty should do it first; if it is something that the people hate very much, then Your Majesty should get rid of it first. What Your Majesty likes and dislikes is the same as what the people of the world like and dislike, and there has never been a case in history where the people of the world are unwilling to turn to Your Majesty. Generally speaking, the root of order and disorder is closely related to the hearts of the people. Moreover, at a time when changes are taking place and the hearts of the people are shaking, it is a critical moment when the hearts of the people are in danger of turning away! When the hearts of the people turn to the ruler, all things will prosper; when the hearts of the people are estranged, all things will be in danger. How can Your Majesty not examine the hearts of the people, share their likes and dislikes, and make the people yearn to belong, so as to stabilize the country?

The pecking frequency can reach 15-16 times per second. Due to the high speed, the impact force on the woodpecker's head during pecking is equal to 1000 times its body weight, or 250 times the pressure experienced by an astronaut during a rocket launch. With such a strong impact force, why doesn't the woodpecker suffer from concussions?\n\nIt turns out that the woodpecker's skull is extremely sturdy. There is a layer of spongy bone around its brain, filled with fluid, which acts as a buffer and shock absorber against external forces. Its head is also surrounded by muscles that have a shock-absorbing effect, keeping the tip of the beak and the head in a straight line, ensuring a strict linear head movement during pecking. If the woodpecker were to tilt its head slightly during pecking, the rotational movement, combined with the impact force, would damage its brain. Precisely because the woodpecker's beak tip and head maintain a straight line, it can withstand the powerful vibrational force, even when pecking over 1,020,000 times a day.",

Creeks on the sunny side all flow into the Wen, and those on the shady side all flow into the Ji. Separating the north from the south is the ancient Great Wall. Ri Guan Peak is fifteen li south of the Great Wall.\n\nIn the twelfth month of the thirty-ninth year of the Qianlong era [1774], I traveled from the capital through wind and snow, passing Qihe and Changqing, traversing the northwest valley of Mount Tai, crossing the boundary of the Great Wall, and arriving in Tai'an. On Dingwei day, together with the magistrate Zhu Xiaochun and his son Ying, I climbed the mountain from the south side. The forty-five-li journey was paved with stone steps, which numbered over seven thousand. There are three valleys on the exact south face of Mount Tai. The middle valley encircles the city of Tai'an, which Li Daoyuan called Huan Water. I initially followed this route, but after covering about half the distance, I crossed the central ridge and continued along the west valley to the summit. In ancient times, people climbed the mountain through the east valley, which had a route called Tianmen, or Heavenly Gate. I did not take that route; the east valley was what they used to call Tianmen Creek. What I passed through, the central ridge and the summit, are now what people call Tianmen, or Heavenly Gate. The path was shrouded in mist and ice, and the steps were barely climbable. When I finally reached the top, the mountain was laden with snow, shining bright in the southern sky. I looked out to see the evening sun illuminating the city, the Wen River, and the mountain of Cuilai, like a painting, while the mist in the middle of the mountain resembled a belt.\n\nOn Wushen day, the last day of the lunar month, at five o'clock in the morning, together with Ying, I sat in the Ri Guan Pavilion, awaiting the sunrise. A strong wind blew the accumulated snow into our faces. From the foot of the mountain to the east of the pavilion, everything was enveloped in clouds. I could vaguely see dozens of white objects standing in the clouds, which were actually mountains. The clouds at the edge of the sky displayed a different color, which soon turned into a five-colored rainbow. The sun rose, a brilliant red, like a ball of crimson, with flickering red light beneath it. Someone said, \"That must be the East China Sea.\" I turned to look at the peaks west of Ri Guan, some bathed in sunlight, some not, displaying a mix of crimson and white, all seeming to bow.\n\nTo the west of the pavilion was the Dai Temple, as well as the Temple of the Goddess Bixia. The imperial palace was located east of the Temple of the Goddess Bixia. The stone inscriptions along the path dated from the Tang dynasty, specifically the Xianqing era [656–661] and later; those from more ancient times had all been obscured and lost. I did not visit the ones that were off the beaten path.\n\nThe mountain had many stones and little soil. The stones were dark gray, mostly rectangular, rarely round. There were few miscellaneous trees and many pines, which grew in the crevices of the rocks, all with flat tops. There was ice and snow, no waterfalls or streams, and no sounds of birds or beasts. Within several li of Ri Guan, there were no trees, and the snow reached the height of a man's knees.\n\nRecorded by Yao Nai of Tongcheng.",
        "output": "On the south side of Mount Tai, the Wen River flows west; on the north side, the Ji River flows east. The waters of the southern valley flow into the Wen River, and the waters of the northern valley flow into the Ji River. The ancient Great Wall runs along the boundary between the two valleys. The Ri Guan Peak is located 15 li south of the Great Wall.\n\nIn the 39th year of the Qianlong reign, in December, I set out from the capital amidst wind and snow. Passing through Qihe and Changqing counties, I traversed the valley northwest of Mount Tai, crossed the Great Wall, and arrived in Tai'an. On this Dingwei day, I climbed the mountain from the southern foot with Zhu Xiaopure, the magistrate of Tai'an, whose courtesy name is Ziyi. The 45-li-long journey consisted of stone steps, totaling over 7,000. There are three valleys on the exact south side of Mount Tai. The water of the middle valley encircles the city of Tai'an; this is the Huan Shui mentioned in Li Daoyuan's book. I initially ascended along the middle valley, covered about half the distance, crossed the central ridge, and then continued along the western valley to reach the summit. In ancient times, the route to Mount Tai followed the eastern valley, where there was a celestial gate. This eastern valley was known in the past as \"Tianmen Stream,\" but I have not ventured there. Now, the central ridge and summit I traversed feature a cliff that resembles a threshold blocking the path, which people call the Celestial Gate. Along the journey, thick fog and icy conditions prevailed, making the stone steps nearly impassable. Upon reaching the summit, I beheld the green mountains covered in white snow, its radiance illuminating the southern sky. Gazing into the distance, the setting sun bathed Tai'an in its glow, while the Wen River and Culai Mountain resembled a beautiful landscape painting. The mist lingering midway on the mountain resembled a dancing ribbon.\n\nOn this Wushen day, which was the end of the month, at the fifth watch, Ziyi and I sat in the Ri Guan Pavilion, awaiting the sunrise. Blustery winds blew the accumulated snow in our faces. To the east of the Ri Guan Pavilion, from the ground down, a sea of clouds spread, through which faintly visible were several dozen white objects resembling dice—those were mountain peaks. The clouds at the horizon formed a line displaying peculiar colors, which soon transformed into a kaleidoscope of hues. The sun rose, red as cinnabar, with flickering crimson rays beneath it. Someone remarked that this must be the East China Sea. Turning back to look at the peaks west of Ri Guan Peak, some bathed in sunlight, others not, presented a mix of red and white, all appearing to bow in reverence.\n\nTo the west of the Ri Guan Pavilion stands the Dai Temple and the Bixia Yuanjun Temple; the imperial palace is located east of the Bixia Yuanjun Temple. On this day, we also examined the stone inscriptions along the road, dating from the Xuanzong era of the Tang dynasty onwards; the older ones were already blurred or missing. There was no time to visit those in remote locations off the road.\n\nThe mountain is abundant in stones but sparse in soil. The rocks are predominantly bluish-black, mostly flat and square, with few round ones. There are few miscellaneous trees, mainly pines, which grow in the crevices of the rocks, their tops flat. In this icy and snowy environment, there were no waterfalls, no sounds or traces of birds and beasts. Within a few li near the Ri Guan Peak, there were no trees, and the snow accumulated to the height of a person's knees.\n\nRecorded by Yao Nai of Tongcheng.",

If we make use of people's strengths to compensate for their weaknesses, then everyone in the world can be put to good use. If we discard people because of their weaknesses and ignore their strengths, then everyone in the world will be abandoned. Moreover, people's emotions are influenced by likes and dislikes, and their interests vary. Even if someone is as wise as Yi Yin or King Zhou, or as virtuous as Mozi or Yang Zhu, they will still be subject to public opinion and criticism.\n\nIn the past, Zigong asked Confucius: 'What if everyone in my hometown likes me?' Confucius replied: 'It is not necessarily a good thing.' 'What if everyone in my hometown dislikes me?' Confucius said: 'It is not necessarily a bad thing. It is better to be liked by the virtuous people in your hometown and disliked by those who are not virtuous.' This is because the intentions of a junzi (noble person) and a xiaoren (small-minded person) are bound to be opposite. Just as a junzi dislikes a xiaoren, a xiaoren will also dislike a junzi. If one wants to understand their true feelings, one must carefully listen and discern the truth. If you listen only to the xiaoren, the path of the junzi will be lost; if you listen only to the junzi, the path of the xiaoren will be eliminated.\"",

Moreover, people's emotions are divided between love and hate, and their interests differ. If one seeks the approval of sages like Yi Yin and Zhou Gong, or wise and virtuous people like Mozi and Yang Zhu, who can avoid being ridiculed?\n\nOnce, Zigong asked Confucius: \"What should be done if everyone in a village likes a person?\" Confucius replied, \"It cannot be determined.\" \"What if everyone in the village dislikes him?\" \"It still cannot be determined. One should not assume that a person is good just because the villagers like him, nor should one dislike him just because they don't.\" This is because the actions of a good person and a bad person must necessarily be different, just as a petty person dislikes a noble person, and a good person dislikes a bad person.

        "output": "Here is the translation of the Chinese text to English:\n\nIAM and Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important transformative role in identity and access management, enabling organizations to take a more nuanced and adaptive approach to authentication and access management. AI is also essential for user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to detect suspicious activities. Malicious logins, a large number of login attempts in a short period, unknown locations, unrecognizable devices, and whether a user is on the company's virtual private network (VPN) are indicators that may suggest malicious activity. AI can flag these indicators for real-time or near-real-time investigations to thwart hacking attempts.\n\nIAM, the Cloud, and IDaaS\n\nIAM from the Cloud: Identity as a Service (IDaaS) and Managed Identity Services.\nA growing number of vendors offer identity and access management services delivered from the cloud. One approach is called Identity as a Service (IDaaS), which can be a standalone solution or a complement to existing on-premises IAM systems. With managed identity services, security providers will monitor and manage enterprise IAM solutions running in the cloud or on-premises, similar to other managed security service offerings.\n\nIAM for the Cloud.\nToday's enterprises have applications and data on-premises, on traditional systems and private clouds, and across one or more public cloud environments. The challenge lies in managing user access to resources as seamlessly as possible, regardless of where those resources reside. An ideal identity and access management system should support SSO and MFA across a hybrid multi-cloud environment.\n\nIAM and BYOD\nIn today's mobile-centric work world, employees want the freedom to work anywhere using their own phones, tablets, laptops, or wearable devices, and organizations are adopting bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies to accommodate this. IAM, combined with a unified endpoint management platform, can help organizations embrace mobility and securely adopt BYOD initiatives.\n\nIAM and the Internet of Things\nThis is a well-known story. A hacker gained access to a company's network and stole customer data by compromising a smart aquarium thermometer. Connected CCTV cameras have also fallen prey to hackers. The lesson is that almost any Internet of Things (IoT) device can be hacked, and without access management, networks are left vulnerable to attacks. Today's IAM solutions treat IoT devices as entities that need to be identified and authorized before granting network access.",

        "output": "In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived a cryptographic electronic money called e-money. Later, in 1995, he implemented an early form of this cryptographic electronic payment system with Digicash. Digicash required user software to withdraw banknotes from the bank and assign specific cryptographic keys before they could be sent to the recipient. This made the digital currency untraceable by third parties.\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. National Security Agency published a paper titled \"How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash,\" describing a cryptocurrency system. The paper was first posted on a mailing list at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later published in the American Law Review in late 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Wei Dai described \"b-money,\" an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. Soon after, Nick Szabo described bit gold. Like Bitcoin and other subsequent cryptocurrencies, bit gold was described as an electronic currency system requiring users to perform a proof-of-work function, with solutions cryptographically merged and published.\n\nIn January 2009, Bitcoin was created by a pseudonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto. It utilized SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created, attempting to form a decentralized DNS. In October 2011, Litecoin was introduced, using scrypt instead of SHA-256 as its hash function. Peercoin, created in August 2012, employed a hybrid of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.\n\nCryptocurrencies have gone through multiple periods of growth and retrenchment, including several bubbles and market crashes, such as in 2011, 2013-2014-15, 2017-2018, and 2021-2023.\n\nOn August 6, 2014, the UK announced that its Treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies and their potential role in the country's economy, if any. The study was also to report on whether or not regulation should be considered. Its final report was released in 2018, and a consultation on crypto-assets and stablecoins was launched in January 2021.\n\nIn June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender after the Legislative Assembly passed a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele with a 62-22 vote.\n\nIn August 2021, Cuba also released Resolution 215, recognizing and regulating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nIn September 2021, the Chinese government, the world's largest cryptocurrency market, declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal. This completed a crackdown that had previously banned intermediary institutions and miners from operating in China.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency globally at the time, completed a consensus mechanism upgrade from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), a process known as \"the Merge.\" According to Ethereum's founder, the upgrade could reduce Ethereum's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by 99.9%.\n\nOn November 11, 2022, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX Trading Ltd., which also operated a crypto hedge fund and was valued at $18 billion, filed for bankruptcy. The financial impact of this collapse extended beyond the FTX customer base, as reported, and during a Reuters event, financial industry executives stated that \"regulators must step in to protect crypto investors.\" Technology analyst Avivah Litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, saying that \"there needs to be significant improvement in user experience, controls, security, and customer service.\"",

These powders typically have no apparent smell or taste.\n\nCrystals: Some drugs can be made into crystalline form and hidden in items such as candies, ice cubes, or gems. These crystals usually have a distinct smell and taste.\n\nTablets: Some drugs can be made into tablet form and hidden in medicines or health products. These tablets usually have no obvious smell or taste.\n\nTo identify drugs, one can look out for the following:\n\nObserve the appearance: Look for any abnormalities in the drug's appearance, such as color, shape, or texture. If there are any irregularities, it could indicate a new-type drug.\n\nSmell: Drugs often have distinct smells, such as chemicals or fragrances. An unusual smell could suggest a new-type drug.\n\nTaste: If it is possible to taste the drug, an unusual taste, such as bitterness or astringency, may be detected. An abnormal flavor could be indicative of a new-type drug.\n\nTesting tools: Using testing tools such as drug testing paper or detectors can quickly determine the presence of drugs.\n\nIn summary, it is essential to be vigilant about the various ways drugs can be hidden. Do not readily accept food or medicine from strangers, and always report suspicious items or individuals to the authorities promptly. Together, we can resist the harm caused by drugs.",

In October 1566, Mary was staying at Jedburgh on the Scottish borders, from where she rode on a journey of at least four hours to visit Bothwell, the Earl of Hertford, at Hermitage Castle, where he lay injured from a skirmish with the borderers. Mary's enemies would later use this ride as evidence that the two were lovers, even though there was no suspicion at the time and Mary was accompanied by her councillors and guards. On her return to Jedburgh, she immediately fell severely ill, suffering from frequent vomiting, loss of vision, loss of speech, convulsions and fainting. She was thought to be close to death. Her recovery, which began on 25 October, was attributed to the skill of a French physician. The cause of her illness is unclear; diagnoses included physical exhaustion and emotional strain, a gastric haemorrhage, and poisoning. At the end of November 1566, Mary and leading nobles met at Craigmillar Castle, near Edinburgh, to discuss 'the Darnley question'. Divorce was discussed, but the nobles present may also have sworn to remove Darnley by other means: 'It was thought convenient and most expedient for the commonwealth... that such a young, innocent gentleman and proud tyrant should not reign or rule over them;... that he should be put off by one way or another; whosoever would take the deed in hand or do it, they should defend.' Darnley, fearing for his safety, went to Glasgow shortly before Christmas, staying at his father's estate, after his son was baptised at Stirling. At the start of the journey, he fell ill with a fever, possibly smallpox or measles, or the result of poison, and was sick for several weeks. In late January 1567, Mary induced her husband to return to Edinburgh. He recovered from his illness at the house of Sir James Balfour...\n\nQuestion: When did Mary go to visit her husband?",

Zhongyong immediately wrote a poem of four lines, including his own name. The poem expressed his desire to take care of his parents and unite his clan. It was shown to all the scholars in the village. From then on, he was able to compose poems about objects on the spot, and his language and logic were admirable. The people of the county found this extraordinary and treated his father as a guest, some even offering money. His father, seeing the benefits, took Zhongyong around the county to meet people and did not make him study. I had heard about this a long time ago. During the Mingdao era, I returned home with my elders and saw Zhongyong at my uncle's house. He was twelve or thirteen at the time. I asked him to compose a poem, but it was not as impressive as what I had heard from before. Seven years later, I returned from Yangzhou and went to my uncle's house to ask about Zhongyong again. The reply was: 'He has become an ordinary person.'\"",

This system is responsible for the breakdown of food, absorption of nutrients, and elimination of waste products.\n\nThe digestive system includes the following organs and their respective functions:\n\n1. Mouth: The mouth is the first part of the digestive system and is responsible for the mechanical breakdown of food through chewing and the initiation of digestion through the production of saliva, which contains enzymes to break down carbohydrates.\n\n2. Pharynx: The pharynx is a muscular tube that connects the mouth to the esophagus. It serves as a passageway for food to travel from the mouth to the stomach and also plays a role in the respiratory system by directing air to the larynx and lungs.\n\n3. Esophagus: The esophagus is a muscular tube that transports chewed food from the pharynx to the stomach. Peristalsis, a wave-like contraction of the esophageal muscles, propels food downwards.\n\n4. Stomach: The stomach is a muscular bag located between the esophagus and the small intestine. It churns and breaks down food further with the help of strong acids and enzymes, killing harmful bacteria and continuing the digestive process.\n\n5. Small Intestine: The small intestine is a long, coiled tube that absorbs most of the nutrients from digested food. It completes the process of digestion and is also responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes.\n\n6. Large Intestine (Colon): The large intestine, or colon, is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes, as well as forming and storing waste products before elimination.\n\n7. Liver: The liver produces bile, which is stored and released into the small intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats. The liver also plays a crucial role in detoxification and metabolism.\n\n8. Pancreas: The pancreas releases digestive enzymes into the small intestine to assist in the breakdown and absorption of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.\n\n9. Gallbladder: The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver, releasing it into the small intestine when needed to aid in fat digestion.",

Look, it goes up in a cloud of smoke and flame, with a roar that deafens. But when it returns to Earth, it glides down silently, making less noise than a large passenger plane as it lands!\n\nTake a look at the shuttle at launch: it's strapped to an external fuel tank that's bigger than itself, with two booster rockets attached. With the help of these \"assistants\", the shuttle first ascends to a height of several dozen kilometers, discarding the two booster rockets when they've used up their fuel (they're recovered by parachute and reused). When it reaches a height of over 100 kilometers, it ditches the bulky external fuel tank, and only then does the shuttle's own engine have enough power to send it into orbit, several hundred kilometers high.\n\nWith all those bulky tanks attached, of course the shuttle can't take off with a horizontal run like a plane, and the air resistance it encounters is far greater than that of a large aircraft. Besides, the rocket engine is designed for short, sharp bursts of power, so the shuttle has to ascend vertically for the first couple of minutes to get through the dense lower atmosphere as quickly as possible. By the time it's returning, it's already shed its cumbersome attachments, and can glide down like a glider.\n\nUsing a reusable space shuttle to launch satellites is cheaper than using traditional carrier rockets that are discarded after one use. But the shuttle can only take off from an expensive launch pad, and it has to be reassembled after each flight, so it can't be reused in a short space of time. So by the 21st century, it will be replaced by an even more advanced space plane.",

When water vapor comes into contact with a cooler surface or object, dew forms. On cloudy nights, heat usually escapes into the air and encounters the cloud layer, with some of it being reflected back to the earth and the rest absorbed by the clouds. Thus, on nights when the sky is full of clouds, the temperature near the ground does not drop easily, making it difficult for dew to form. If there is wind during the night, it will cause air convection, increasing the temperature of the air near the ground and dispersing the water vapor, again making it difficult for dew to form.",

The people of Yixing referred to these three disasters as the 'Three Evils', with Zhou Chu being the most notorious.

The people of the village assumed that they had both perished and celebrated. In the end, Zhou Chu managed to kill the flood dragon and return alive. Upon hearing the villagers' celebration, he realized that he had been a source of trouble for them and decided to mend his ways. He then sought out the two Lu brothers in Wu. While Plain Lu was not there, he met with Clear Creek Lu, to whom he confessed his past and expressed his desire to reform despite having wasted his youth, feeling that he had accomplished nothing. Clear Creek Lu said, 'The ancients valued those who were determined to improve even if it meant death, so how could you, with your future still ahead of you, not establish your aspirations and instead worry about not achieving a good name?' Inspired, Zhou Chu changed his ways and eventually became a loyal subject and filial son.\"",
        "output": "When Zhou Chu was young, he was willful and aggressive, often fighting and brawling. He was a major scourge in the area. In addition, there was a flood dragon in the Yixing water and a white-headed tiger on the mountain, which together harmed the people. The locals called them the \"Three Harms\", among which Zhou Chu was the most harmful. So someone asked Zhou Chu: \"Since you are so capable, why don't you kill the tiger and the flood dragon to prove your strength?\" In fact, they hoped that the three harms would fight each other, leaving only one survivor. After hearing this, Zhou Chu immediately went up the mountain to kill the tiger, and then jumped into the water to fight the flood dragon. The flood dragon floated and dived in the water, and the fight drifted dozens of miles away. After three days and three nights, the locals thought that both the flood dragon and Zhou Chu had died, and they came out to celebrate. However, Zhou Chu had killed the flood dragon and was climbing up the shore, holding its head. When he heard that the villagers thought he was dead and were celebrating, he realized that everyone also considered him a scourge, and he couldn't help but burst into tears and feel remorse. He then went to Wu County to seek Lu Ji and Lu Yun, two famous scholars of Eastern Wu at that time. It happened that Lu Ji was not there, and he only met Lu Yun. Zhou Chu told him everything and said, \"I want to correct my mistakes, but I have wasted my time and fear that I will not have any achievements in the end.\" Lu Yun said, \"The ancients valued morality and believed that 'even if one understands the truth in the morning and dies at night, one will be content.' Moreover, your future is still hopeful. As long as you can set goals and work hard, why worry that your good reputation will not be spread?\" After hearing this, Zhou Chu decided to turn over a new leaf and eventually became a loyal and filial generation.",

Why do the staff on aircraft carriers dress in different colors?\n\nIt turns out that this is related to the unique work environment of an aircraft carrier. Aircraft carriers differ from ground airports, and their flight decks are quite limited in area, with various personnel working in close quarters. To maintain good order at work and facilitate recognition and unified command and management, those with different tasks must wear different-colored uniforms. Those in yellow are usually observers on the ship, responsible for the takeoff and landing of carrier-based aircraft and the safety of those around them. People in blue generally specialize in chocking aircraft wheels and covering aircraft intake ducts. People in red are only responsible for lifesaving, salvage, and firefighting. Those in green are only in charge of aircraft launch and arrested recovery. Those dressed in purple are mainly responsible for aircraft refueling. Those in white are all aircraft maintenance personnel, mainly responsible for aircraft inspection, maintenance, and repair, and those in white clothing with a red cross are mostly medical staff on the ship.\n\nThus, the various colors and markings of the uniforms make the division of labor clear and distinct, with each person having their own role.

Scarf: As the weather turns cooler and winter approaches, a warm and stylish scarf will be a thoughtful gift for your boyfriend. Opt for colors like blue, gray, or coffee, and if you have the time, knitting one yourself will make it even more special and likely to be cherished by him.\n\n2. Couple Jewelry: Many couples enjoy wearing clothing and jewelry that bear each other's marks, such as matching couple outfits or accessories engraved with each other's names. Consider getting couple rings, earrings, bracelets, or pendants. There are plenty of shops that offer couple DIY accessories, so you can wear one piece while sending the other to your long-distance love. Even if you're not physically together, your hearts will still be connected.\n\n3. Flowers: Birthdays are incomplete without flowers! Flowers add a touch of romance and warmth to your already intense love. Send your boyfriend flowers like sunflowers, red roses, or scented lilies, which all symbolize love and affection. Instead of a single type of flower, go for a bouquet with a variety of blooms to make it look richer and more thoughtful. \n\nWhen celebrating your long-distance boyfriend's birthday, it's ideal to be together, but if that's not possible, make sure to send a thoughtful gift to show you care.",

        "output": "The washing machine was invented in the 19th century. Washing machines can be generally categorized into agitator-type, impeller-type, and drum-type. The agitator-type washing machine marked the beginning of modern laundry technology and was the first true revolution in laundry, freeing human hands from the chore ever since.\n\nAgitator-type washing machines apply the principle of agitation, using chemical and mechanical actions to clean clothes. Impeller-type washing machines have a simpler structure and can be further divided into two types: semi-automatic twin-tub and fully automatic impeller. They generate a strong water flow by rapidly rotating the impeller at the bottom, and the friction between clothes, water flow, and the tub removes dirt.\n\nThe drum-type washing machine is the most popular type worldwide. After more than 80 years of technological development, it represents mature modern laundry technology. Its washing principle involves rotating the inner drum clockwise and counterclockwise, lifting and dropping the clothes and water; allowing the detergent to thoroughly penetrate the clothes, and cleaning them through squeezing, beating actions, and overhead spraying water flow. Drum-type washing machines have not only led another new revolution in laundry technology but also continue to improve with the development of smart technology.\n\nThe washing machine that does not use detergent is a new type of ultrasonic washing machine that does not require the addition of any substances. Its working principle is based on high-frequency vibration signals generated by an ultrasonic generator, which are converted by a transducer and propagated into the water. This creates countless tiny bubbles in the water flow, and the momentary high pressure causes the bubbles to produce a series of miniature \"explosions,\" continuously impacting the surface of the clothes and dislodging dirt and grime from the surface and crevices of the fabric.",

They will eat carrion and even resort to cannibalism. Wolf packs can sometimes pose a danger to humans. Wolves have a large appetite and can consume dozens of pounds of meat in one sitting. They can also go for months without food while remaining fiercely aggressive.\n\nWolves are nocturnal creatures, typically emerging at dusk to hunt in packs. As they move, they emit low howls. Animal calls are a means of communication, with different calls conveying different messages and playing a significant role in their breeding habits.\n\nThe purpose of howling at night is to gather as a pack. For example, a mother wolf may howl to call her cubs, and a male wolf may respond to the female's call. Once assembled, they venture out to hunt. During the breeding season, wolves may also howl to find mates. Young wolves, when hungry, will emit high-pitched cries.\n\nWolves pose a severe threat to domestic fowl, livestock, and various wild animals. Therefore, they are considered pests and should be hunted in a controlled manner.",

Conversely, when air pressure increases, it is because the air has contracted and its density has increased. Therefore, air pressure in winter is higher than in summer. You may ask: If the air is expanding everywhere in the summer, where does the excess air go? It is because the seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres of the Earth are opposite. So the extra air expanded in the summer hemisphere goes to the winter hemisphere to make up for the lack of air there.",

Should I take up this post, I must do so with integrity and courage, ready to face any consequences that may arise from speaking truth to power. The Emperor rules with filial piety; if I were to use your old age as an excuse to decline, I might be spared.' His mother said, 'No, I've heard that advisors are the Emperor's disputing subjects. Your father always wanted this position but never got the chance. Now that you have this opportunity, you must dedicate yourself to serving the country. Even if you are punished and exiled, no matter how far away, I will follow you.' And so he accepted the appointment. For many years, he served with integrity, standing firm in the face of adversity. When he had to confront the Emperor directly, even when the Emperor was furious, he would hold his tablet and stand his ground, waiting for the anger to subside before continuing to speak his mind. Those who attended the court from a distance would watch in awe, their bodies shrinking with fear, and they would call him 'Tiger of the Court.' Such was the respect and awe he commanded.\"",

The Emperor governs the world with filial piety. If I use the excuse of your old age, I should be able to avoid taking up this position.\" His mother said: \"That would be wrong. I've heard that an advisor is a close and bold minister who speaks his mind in front of the Emperor. Your father wanted to be such an official all his life but couldn't, and now you have the fortune to take up this role. You should dedicate your life to repay the country's great grace. Even if you are punished and exiled, no matter how far, I will surely accompany you.\" (An Shi) accepted the position. He served for many years, standing solemnly in the court and upholding fairness. He rebuked people to their faces and argued in the court, sometimes encountering the Emperor's great anger. He would then grasp his handboard and take a step back, waiting for the Emperor's anger to subside before stepping forward to argue again. Those attending to the Emperor from a distance would shrink in fear, their bodies breaking into a cold sweat, and they referred to him as a \"Tiger in the Court.\" For a time, there was no one who did not admire him.",

It primarily consists of recorded sayings and dialogues of Confucius and his disciples, encapsulating his political ideals, ethical thoughts, moral principles, and educational philosophies. Together with the \"Great Learning,\" the \"Doctrine of the Mean,\" and the \"Mengzi,\" it is known as one of the \"Four Books.\" The standard edition of the \"Analects of Confucius\" comprises twenty chapters. The language of the \"Analects\" is concise and refined, and its meanings are profound. Many of Confucius's sayings are still regarded as timeless truths by people today.",

Athletes who are good at loop drives and cuts usually choose reversed-rubber rackets.

When the racket hits the ball, the rubber surface will concave inward, increasing the contact area and friction with the ball. \n\nIt is this \"stickiness\" and larger friction of the racket surface that makes the topspin loop drives and backspin cuts spin more fiercely.",

The process started by carving characters into the strips, then punching holes on one side, and finally binding them together with silk threads or leather straps to form a book shaped like the Chinese character \"ce.\" However, the surface of the bamboo strips, known as \"zhu qing,\" contained oily components that made carving difficult, and bamboo was also susceptible to insect damage. Therefore, ancient people came up with a solution: they placed the bamboo strips over a fire to roast them. This process of roasting, or \"killing the green,\" made it easier to carve characters and also prevented insect damage, becoming an essential step in the book-making process.\n\nThis step was called \"killing the green\" (\"sha qing\"), and it was also known as \"sweating the blue\" (\"han qing\" or \"han jian\"). Thus, the term \"sha qing\" came into being. \n\nBy the time of the Qin Dynasty, brushes were invented, and the characters on the bamboo and wooden strips could be written with brushes instead of being carved with knives. At that time, people often composed their drafts using brushes on the zhu qing surface because it was smooth, and any corrections could be easily wiped away. Once the draft was finalized, the zhu qing layer would be scraped off, and the final version would be written on the white bamboo surface. This process was also called \"killing the green.\"",

In the visible light spectrum, red light has the longest wavelength and the smallest deflection angle, making it easy to pass through water layers, raindrops, dust, and mist. Orange and yellow light are also unobstructed and can penetrate the aforementioned objects. Therefore, fire engines are painted red so that people can spot them from a distance in weather conditions such as dense fog, dusty environments, or heavy storms, allowing them to yield and thus facilitating the fire engine to reach its destination quickly for fire fighting and rescue missions.",

It allows us to calculate the area under a curve or, more generally, the volume bounded by a surface or higher-dimensional manifold.\n\nThe key idea behind the Riemann integral is the partitioning of an interval or region into smaller subintervals or subregions and the evaluation of the function at selected points within each subinterval or subregion. By considering the sum of the function values at these points weighted by the width or size of the subintervals or subregions, we can approximate the total area or volume.\n\nMore specifically, for a function f defined on an interval [a, b], a Riemann sum is formed by dividing the interval into n subintervals, selecting a sample point xi in each subinterval, and calculating the product of f(xi) and the width of the subinterval. The Riemann integral is then defined as the limit of the Riemann sums as the number of subintervals approaches infinity, provided that such a limit exists and is unique.\n\nThe Riemann integral has several important properties, including linearity, additivity, and monotonicity. It also satisfies the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which establishes the connection between differentiation and integration. The Riemann integral is widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and probability theory, providing a powerful tool for solving problems involving rates of change, accumulated quantities, and probability distributions.",

Most often associated with manufacturing, such as Toyota, kaizen is also used in non-manufacturing environments. Kaizen can take the form of individuals, suggestion systems, small groups, or large groups. At Toyota, this usually involves localized improvements to a particular workstation or area and involves a group improving their own workspace and productivity. A first-line supervisor typically guides this group through the kaizen process; sometimes this is also a key role for the line supervisor. Achieve comprehensive quality management, increase productivity through the use of machinery and computational power, and free up manpower. While kaizen (at Toyota) typically brings about small improvements, the culture of constantly tweaking small improvements and standardization has yielded significant results in overall productivity gains. This philosophy differs from mid-20th-century \"command-and-control\" improvement schemes (e.g., business process improvement). The kaizen approach includes making changes, monitoring the results, and then adjusting. Massive pre-planning and extensive project scheduling are replaced by smaller experiments that can quickly adapt as new improvement suggestions arise. Their scope is limited, and the issues generated from them are often used for later kaizen events. Individuals who make significant contributions to successful kaizen implementations during kaizen activities are awarded the title of \"Zen Kaizen-sha.\"\n\nAs a way to help clients restructure and reposition their business processes, business consultants around the world began widely adopting and sharing the Kaizen framework in the 21st century.\n\nQ: How do employees at the Toyota company improve productivity?\n\nA: 丰田公司的员工通过持续改进工作站或工作区的局部改进来提高生产率，这涉及到一个小组改善自己的工作环境和生产力。这个过程由一线主管提供指导，有时线主管也会发挥关键作用。他们利用机械和计算能力提高生产力，实现全面的质量管理，并释放人力。虽然每次改善的幅度很小，但不断调整和标准化的文化使这些小改进累积起来带来了显著的整体生产力提升。与20世纪中叶的“指挥和控制”改进计划（例如，业务流程改进）不同，丰田的改善方法包括实施改变、监测结果，然后根据需要进行调整。大规模预先计划和广泛的项目安排被更灵活的小型实验所取代，这些实验可以根据新的改进建议迅速调整。员工在开斋活动中提出的问题通常会被后续的开斋事件所采用。在开斋活动中为开斋成功实施做出重大贡献的人将获得“禅开先师”的称号。",

Someone who did not know the details reported to the king of Han: \"Chancellor Xiao He has run away.\" The king of Han was extremely angry, as if he had lost his right-hand man. After a day or two, Xiao He returned to see the king of Han, and the king of Han was both angry and pleased. He scolded: \"Why did you run away?\" Xiao He replied: \"I dare not run away, I was chasing the runaway person.\" \"Who did you bring back?\" asked the king of Han. \"Han Xin,\" replied Xiao He. The king of Han scolded again: \"Dozens of officers have run away, and you didn't chase any of them. Instead, you went after Han Xin. This is a lie.\" Xiao He said, \"Those officers are easy to come by, but a talent like Han Xin is a one-in-a-million find. Your Majesty, if you just want to remain as the king of Hanzhong, then of course you won't need him. But if you want to compete for the world, then apart from Han Xin, there is no one else with whom you can discuss grand plans. It all depends on what Your Majesty intends to do.\"",

All of you, please speak your mind.\" The ministers all praised: \"Your Majesty's grace is as vast as the universe, beyond the expression of words.\" The emperor said: \"Not so. The reason I have achieved this is solely due to five things. Since ancient times, emperors have often despised those better than themselves. I, when seeing the goodness in others, feel as if it is my own. As people cannot be perfect, I always discard their shortcomings and embrace their strengths. Emperors often wish to favor the wise by keeping them close, and get rid of the unworthy by pushing them away. I, when encountering the wise, respect them, and when encountering the unworthy, pity them, so that each finds their proper place. Emperors often dislike those who are upright and honest, secretly punishing and openly executing them, and this has happened in every dynasty. Since my ascension, upright and honest scholars have filled the court, and I have never demoted or punished a single one. Since ancient times, emperors have valued the Central Plains and looked down upon the barbarians. I alone have loved them equally, and so their tribes have relied on me as they would their parents. These five reasons are why I have achieved the success of today.\" Then he turned to Chu Suiliang and asked: \"You have been a historian. Regarding what I have said, have I truly grasped the essence?\" Chu replied: \"Your Majesty's virtues are boundless and immeasurable. These five things you mentioned are but a humble expression of your modesty.\"",

My talent is not superior to that of the ancient emperors, yet my achievements are greater than theirs. I don't know the reason for this. Please be frank and tell me.\" \n\nThe ministers replied, \"Your Majesty's merit and virtue are as vast as the heavens and the earth. There is nothing more to say about other things.\" \n\nTang Taizong said, \"This is not the case. The reason I have such achievements is simply because I have done the following five things: First, since ancient times, emperors have often been jealous of those who are better than them. When I see the strengths of others, I treat them as my own strengths and regard them as if they were my own virtues. Second, no one is perfect, so I focus on their strengths and overlook their weaknesses. Third, most monarchs want to keep talented people close when they see their good qualities, but want to push them into the abyss when they see their flaws. However, when I encounter talented and virtuous people, I respect them, and when I see those who are not performing well, I educate them from a caring perspective. In this way, both the capable and the less capable are given their due respect and guidance. Fourth, most monarchs dislike being criticized directly and often secretly harm or openly attack those who speak up. However, since I ascended the throne, there have been many who have spoken frankly, and not one of them has been dismissed because of their honesty. Fifth, traditionally, the Han ethnicity was considered superior, and discrimination against ethnic minorities was common. However, I have treated everyone equally and with care, so the ethnic minorities have come to rely on me as they would their parents. These five points are the reasons for my success today.\"",

In the evening, when he returned home, he would forget all about the cows he had been tending. Wang Mian's father would fly into a rage and beat him. But he continued to do the same thing. His mother said, \"If this child is so enamored with studying, why not let him?\" From then on, Wang Mian left home and lived in a temple. At night, he would quietly come out and sit on the lap of a Buddha statue, book in hand, reading by the light of the eternal lamp before the Buddha. He would read aloud, his voice echoing, until dawn. The Buddha statues were mostly made of clay, each with a fierce and ugly face that was frightening to behold.

In the middle of Jianwu, Min Zhongshu was appointed as an official by Situ Houba. But when he took office, Situ Houba only asked about his well-being and did not discuss matters of governance. Zhongshu lamented, \"When I first received your appointment, I was both happy and afraid. Now that I have met you, I am neither excited nor fearful. If you think that Zhongshu lacks the wisdom to discuss politics, you should not have appointed me as an official. Since you have appointed me but do not make use of me, it shows a lack of discernment in people.\" He then resigned from his post and left with a letter of complaint.",

The wooden lotus tree is 2-5 meters tall, with crowded branches and stems with soft hair. The leaves and flowers are arranged alternately and singly at the ends of the branches. The most famous lotus is the \"San Zui Furong\" (Three Drunken Lotus). As it opens as a white flower in the early morning, turns peach-colored at noon, and becomes purple-red in the evening, it is thus named.\n\nThere is also a more peculiar type of lotus than the \"San Zui Furong\", which changes color day by day after blooming for several days. It is white on the first day, yellow on the second, red on the third, and purple-red on the fourth. When it withers, it turns brown.\n\nThe wooden lotus is very commonly planted in China. In Chengdu, Sichuan, every deep autumn, thousands upon thousands of lotuses bloom on the streets and alleys, decorating the city like a beautiful painting, hence the name \"Rongcheng\" (City of Lotus).",

Drinking sufficient water enables the body to cool down through sweat evaporation or urinary excretion of excess heat. Additionally, certain illnesses are caused by pathogenic bacteria. Drinking ample water, which is then absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and enters the bloodstream, can dilute and help eliminate the toxins produced by bacteria in the blood through urination. As high fevers often disrupt the body's metabolism and may lead to the presence of harmful substances in the blood, drinking ample water can dilute and remove these harmful substances, thereby reducing their adverse effects on the body.",

        "output": "Case content: Xiaohan encountered a puzzling problem when purchasing a new LCD TV recently. Even though she had done her research before shopping, when she compared the two models she was interested in at the store, she found that even though both were labeled as 32 inches, one of the screens seemed slightly smaller than the other. In theory, a component as standardized as a screen should not show such differences, so could it be that her vision was misleading her? However, Xiaohan firmly believes that her mild nearsightedness of only 100 degrees is not enough to cause such a misunderstanding. So, what is going on? How are screen sizes calculated? Is it true that products with the same dimensions can have screens of different sizes?\n\nExpert interpretation: Screen size is actually the first thing consumers consider when purchasing a machine, but it is also the first thing that is overlooked. For most consumers, 32 inches or 42 inches are just concepts; they only differentiate between large and small sizes without any actual visual comparison. In fact, the screen size of LCD TVs is measured by the length of the diagonal of the TV screen, usually in inches (1 inch equals 2.538 centimeters).\n\nDue to the characteristics of LCD screens, they are not covered by border lines, so generally speaking, the screen size of LCD TVs should be accurate, and because LCD screens are cut according to whole-size dimensions, they usually do not appear to be lacking in any way. However, this is usually the case; there are a very small number of manufacturers in the market who use non-A-grade screens or screens with inferior craftsmanship to reduce production costs, resulting in a discrepancy of 1 to 2 centimeters less than the standard size, making it seem slightly smaller. Another situation is that some manufacturers have to compromise on the size of the screen slightly to adjust the physical resolution of the screen. Therefore, it is best for consumers to choose well-known brands when purchasing LCD TVs to avoid this \"short-changing\" phenomenon.",

This causes intense air turbulence within the cumulonimbus cloud, creating a rotational effect. When this rotational effect becomes strong enough, it forms a tornado.\n\nAdditionally, the drastic temperature difference between the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere, with cold air rapidly descending and warm air vigorously ascending, causes alternating disturbances in the air layers, forming numerous small vortices. As these small vortices expand, the turbulence between the layers intensifies, eventually forming a large vortex and, consequently, a tornado.",

On January 30, 1895, at 08:30, the Japanese army occupied the Mashi Heights Battery. The Qing army's land batteries immediately concentrated their fire on the Mashi Heights Battery, while the naval commander Ding Ruchang also led the \"Dingyuan\", \"Jingyuan\", \"Laiyuan\", \"Guangbing\", and several mosquito boats to near the South Bang Battery to provide supporting fire. The Japanese troops who captured the Mashi Heights Battery took advantage of the momentum to capture the weakly defended Long Temple Mouth Battery and used it to attack the Beiyang Fleet right in front of them. The sudden bombardment caught the Beiyang Fleet off guard, and one of the shells hit the observation port of the \"Guangbing\" command tower, killing the deputy captain, Huang Zulian. On February 1, the North Bang Battery fell, cutting off all land transportation to Weihaiwei. The defending Suijun army commander, Dai Zongquan, committed suicide. The Japanese army then repeatedly used light vessels to launch strong attacks on the Beiyang Fleet anchorage. After 04:00 on the 6th, the Japanese torpedo boat squad launched its fourth strong attack, while the army's artillery on the north shore of Weihai fired shells. The \"Jingyuan\", \"Jiyuan\", \"Pingyuan\", and \"Guangbing\" fired at the north shore, while the other ships fired at the torpedo boat squad. The Beiyang Fleet, heavily besieged and lacking aid, had only the \"Pingyuan\", \"Jiyuan\", and \"Guangbing\" still capable of fighting after many days of battle, and even these ships had run out of large-caliber artillery shells. Seeing no chance of breaking out and with no reinforcements in sight, Ding Ruchang ordered the damaged ships to be sunk to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. On the 9th, the \"Guangbing\" used torpedoes to sink the already stranded \"Jingyuan\", then approached the \"Dingyuan\" and placed 350 pounds of explosives in the middle of the ship. At 15:15, the explosives detonated, destroying the \"Dingyuan's\" engine room and causing its two funnels to collapse. On the 11th, Ding Ruchang committed suicide by poison. In the following days, the captain of the \"Guangbing\", Cheng Biguang, and the Weihai Logistics Department head, Niu Changpeng, boarded the \"Matsushima\" several times to discuss surrender. At 08:30 on the 17th, the Combined Fleet sailed into the port of Weihaiwei. The remaining ten ships of the Beiyang Fleet, including the \"Guangbing\", lowered the Qing dynasty flags and hoisted the Japanese flags.",

In communication technology, this process is called \"modulation\" and is performed by a \"modulator\". The modulator can modulate different voice and image signals into optical signals with different frequency bands. Since the frequency band of light waves is very wide, there is a great deal of flexibility, and it can accommodate a large number of different telephone frequency bands.\n\nIn theory, on such a wide frequency band of optical fibers, it would be no problem to support one hundred million people talking at the same time. It is just that, in practice, due to limitations of the equipment for optical-electrical conversion, this capacity cannot be reached, but it is absolutely no problem to enable tens of thousands of phone calls to go through simultaneously without a hitch! In actual use, on an optical fiber thinner than a hair, tens of thousands of phone calls or thousands of television programs can be transmitted at the same time.\n\nIf we combine dozens of optical fibers into one optical cable, its capacity is beyond imagination.",
