These officers came from the higher strata of society and had a good education. \n\nReasons: The Decembrists were discontent with the absolute power of the Russian Emperor and the lack of political freedoms. They sought to limit the monarch's power, introduce a constitution, and abolish serfdom. \n\nLeaders: The revolt had several leaders, including Pyotr Kakhovsky, Sergey Muravyov-Apostol, and Pavel Pestel. They attempted a coup by arming the officers and calling for a change in the political system. \n\nSuppression: The uprising was quickly and harshly suppressed by government troops. Many participants were arrested, some executed, and others sentenced to long terms of exile. \n\nConsequences: The Decebrist revolt did not lead to instant changes in the political system of the Russian Empire, but it left a legacy of Enlightenment and liberal ideas, which became important in the movement towards political reforms in Russia in the future. \n\nIn Russia's history, the Decembrist revolt is often viewed as the first serious attempt to alter the political structure, and it had a profound influence on subsequent historical events and reforms in the country.",

By November-December 1988, most residents of both republics were involved in this conflict, and it effectively outgrew the local problem of Nagorno-Karabakh, turning into an open interethnic confrontation.\n\nIn 1991-1994, this confrontation led to large-scale military actions for control over Nagorno-Karabakh and some adjacent territories. On May 5, 1994, the Bishkek Protocol on a ceasefire between Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) on the one hand, and Azerbaijan on the other, was signed.\n\nThe result of the armed conflict was its \"freezing\" and the de facto independence of the NKR from Azerbaijan. 92.5% of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and the so-called \"security zone\" - districts that were not administratively subordinate to the autonomous oblast but surrounded its territory - came under the control of the NKR. The conflict led to significant ethnic changes in the region. All Azerbaijanis and Kurds living in the zone of combat operations fled, as did almost all Armenians living outside the zone of Armenian control, and almost all Azerbaijanis left Armenia.",

During this period, his long-time secretary, Mahadev Desai, died of a heart attack, his wife, Kasturba, died after 18 months of imprisonment on February 22, 1944, and Gandhi himself suffered a severe bout of malaria. While in prison, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then prepared and published a summary of the interview, telegraphing it to the mainstream press, in which sudden concessions that Gandhi was willing to make were announced—comments that shocked his countrymen, Congress workers, and even Gandhi himself. The latter two claimed that Gelder had misrepresented what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the 'Quit India' movement. Gandhi was released before the end of the war, on May 6, 1944, due to his poor health and the need for an operation; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. He emerged from captivity to a changed political landscape—for instance, the Muslim League, which a few years ago seemed marginal, 'now occupied center stage in politics,' and the theme of Muhammad Ali Jinnah's campaign for Pakistan was the main topic of discussion. Gandhi and Jinnah had an extensive correspondence, and the two men met several times over two weeks in September 1944, where Gandhi insisted on a united, religiously plural, and independent India that included the Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. Jinnah rejected this proposal and instead insisted on the division of the subcontinent along religious lines to create a separate Muslim India (later Pakistan). These discussions continued until 1947. While Congress leaders languished in jail, other parties supported the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications spoke out against the harsh suppression of the Congress but had little control over events. At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point, Gandhi withdrew...\n\nQuestion: How many years did Gandhi spend in jail?\"",

In the Battle of Austerlitz, according to the disposition of forces, Przybyszewski's column advanced from the Pratzen Heights and occupied Sokolnice. Napoleon, by attacking Pratzen, split the allied army and sent a part of his forces to the rear of Przybyszewski, while Davout assaulted him head-on. Surrounded on all sides, Przybyszewski decided to break through to the right, towards the village of Kobelnitz. Under artillery and rifle fire, the Russian detachment managed to cover the two-verst distance from Sokolnice to Kobelnitz only by evening, by which time it had turned into a shapeless and poorly organized mass. As they neared the village, French cavalry cut into the remnants of Przybyszewski's forces, completing their disarray. Przybyszewski himself was taken prisoner. The generals, staff officers, and junior officers, as well as the cannons and banners, all fell into the hands of the victors. Fewer than 1,000 soldiers managed to escape the encirclement, fleeing individually. Nonetheless, the desperate and prolonged resistance of the 3rd Column facilitated the retreat of the first two Russian columns.\"",

Религиозность в Германии наиболее выражена в бывшей Восточной Германии, которая раньше была преимущественно протестантской, а также в крупных столичных районах. По оценкам 2017 года, 37,0% населения Германии не принадлежали ни к одной конфессии. Ислам является второй по величине религией в стране. В ходе переписи 2011 года 1,9% населения (1,52 миллиона человек) указали ислам в качестве своей религии, но эти данные считаются недостоверными, поскольку непропорционально большое число последователей этой религии (а также других религий, таких как иудаизм) скорее всего воспользовались своим правом не отвечать на этот вопрос. По данным Религиоведческой информационно-аналитической службы, в 2015 году их число составляло от 4,4 до 4,7 миллионов человек (около 5,5% населения). Исследование, проведенное Федеральным управлением по миграции и беженцам, показало, что с 2011 по 2015 год мусульманское население увеличилось на 1,2 миллиона человек, в основном за счет иммиграции. Большинство мусульман сунниты и алавиты из Турции, но также есть небольшое число шиитов, ахмадийцев и последователей других течений. К другим религиям, на которые приходится менее одного процента населения Германии, относятся буддизм (270 000 последователей), иудаизм (200 000) и индуизм (около 100 000).

He worked for a year as a laboratory assistant at the Ulyanovsk Higher Military Command School of Communications. He was seriously involved in sports and in 1985 became the boxing champion of the USSR among youths.",
        "output": "Since 1991, he took part in combat operations on the Tajik-Afghan border. He was the commander of the 1st DRP (paratrooper assault guard) of the paratrooper assault maneuver group of the Moscow Border Detachment. He participated in numerous combat operations, for which he was awarded the Order \"For Personal Courage\" and the Medal \"For Courage\". Under his command, the group inflicted heavy losses on bandit formations and drug trafficker groups. Thus, during one of the ambushes, a three-ton shipment of heroin was intercepted. The bandits put a $300,000 bounty on the officer's head. During his entire service in Tajikistan, Dmitry Razumovsky did not lose a single subordinate.\n\nIn 1993, Razumovsky suffered a severe concussion in one of the battles. While in the hospital, Dmitry learned about the death of his friends from the 12th border guard post - the chief of the guard post, Mikhail Maiboroda, was his best friend. He met his future wife, Erika, at Mikhail's funeral and named his eldest son after him.\n\nIn 1994, Razumovsky was forced to resign from the army after his letter about corruption among the command and the senseless death due to the negligence of the higher-ups of the Russian border guards and military in Tajikistan was published in several central newspapers.\n\nAfter his resignation, he returned to Ulyanovsk and tried to find his place in civilian life, but without success. On recommendation, in October 1996, he was invited to serve in the state security agencies of the Russian Federation. He served in Directorate \"V\", better known as the \"Vympel\" group.\n\nTogether with the \"Vympel\" group, Lieutenant Colonel Razumovsky arrived in the city of Beslan, Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, where, on September 1, 2004, a group of thirty-two terrorists led by Ruslan Khuchbarov took over a thousand children and adults hostage in School No. 1.\n\nOn the third day of the seizure, explosions occurred in the gym where most of the hostages were held, causing part of the roof to collapse. The surviving hostages began to flee, and Razumovsky's assault group received an order to storm the building. Under heavy fire, Razumovsky directed his subordinates to the enemy's firing points but was fatally shot by a sniper in the school yard.\n\nFor his courage and heroism in the performance of a special assignment, by the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation dated September 6, 2004, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Aleksandrovich Razumovsky was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation (medal No. 829).\n\nOn September 7, 2004, Dmitry Razumovsky was buried at the Nikolo-Arkhangelskoye cemetery in Moscow, together with eight other employees of the special forces \"Alpha\" and \"Vympel\" who died during the counter-terrorist operation in Beslan.\n\nIn 2004, a documentary film \"Unknown Soldier. The Last Trip\" dedicated to the memory of D. Razumovsky was released. At the initiative of a local resident who also participated in the rescue of the hostages, a memorial plaque was installed at the site of Razumovsky's death in Beslan (2011).",

After graduating from School No. 1 in Ulyanovsk, Dmitry attempted to enroll in a military academy but was unsuccessful in the competitive entrance exam. He spent a year working as a lab assistant at the Ulyanovsk Higher Military Command School of Communications. He was heavily involved in sports and became the 1985 USSR youth boxing champion.\"",

He was the commander of the 1st DRP (parachute assault guard) of the parachute assault maneuver group of the Moscow Border Guard detachment. He participated in numerous combat operations, for which he was awarded the Order \"For Personal Courage\" and the Medal \"For Courage\". Under his command, the group inflicted heavy losses on bandit formations and drug trafficker groups. Thus, during one of the ambushes, a three-ton shipment of heroin was intercepted. The bandits put a $300,000 bounty on the officer's head. During his entire service in Tajikistan, Dmitry Razumovsky did not lose a single subordinate.\n\nIn 1993, Razumovsky suffered a severe concussion in one of the battles. While in the hospital, Dmitry learned about the death of his friends from the 12th border guard, including the chief of the guard, Mikhail Maiboroda, who was his best friend. He met his future wife, Erika, at Mikhail's funeral and named his eldest son after him.\n\nIn 1994, Razumovsky was forced to resign from the army after his letter about corruption among the command and the senseless death of Russian border guards and military in Tajikistan due to the higher-ups was published in several central newspapers.\n\nAfter his resignation, he returned to Ulyanovsk and tried to find his place in civilian life, but unsuccessfully. On recommendation, in October 1996, he was invited to serve in the state security agencies of the Russian Federation. He served in Directorate \"V\", better known as the \"Vympel\" group.\n\nTogether with the \"Vympel\" group, Lieutenant Colonel Razumovsky arrived in the city of Beslan, Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, where, on September 1, 2004, a group of thirty-two terrorists led by Ruslan Khuchbarov took over a thousand children and adults hostage in School No. 1.\n\nOn the third day of the seizure, explosions occurred in the gym where most of the hostages were held, causing part of the roof to collapse. The surviving hostages began to flee, and Razumovsky's assault group received an order to storm the building. Under heavy fire, Razumovsky directed his subordinates to the enemy's firing points but was fatally shot by a sniper in the schoolyard.\n\nFor his courage and heroism in carrying out a special assignment, by the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation dated September 6, 2004, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Aleksandrovich Razumovsky was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation (medal #829).\n\nOn September 7, 2004, Dmitry Razumovsky was buried at the Nikolo-Arkhangelskoye cemetery in Moscow, together with eight other employees of the special forces \"Alpha\" and \"Vympel\" who died during the counter-terrorist operation in Beslan.\n\nIn 2004, a documentary film \"Unknown Soldier. The Last Trip\" dedicated to the memory of D. Razumovsky was released. In 2011, a memorial plaque was installed in Beslan at the site of Razumovsky's death, initiated by a local resident who also participated in the hostage rescue.",

Those who rejected the innovations and preferred to maintain the old rites and traditions became known as \"Old Believers.\" Old Belief became a broader and more diverse movement, encompassing various groups and sects, each of which might have had its own interpretations and teachings.\n\nOld Believers considered themselves defenders of the true faith and practiced the old church rites that had been established before Nikon's reforms. They also refused to accept altered versions of the texts of church books and prayer books.\n\nBecause of their persistent opposition to the official church and state, Old Believers faced persecution and discrimination during different periods of Russian history. Some Old Believer communities continue to exist today, and their numbers may vary depending on the region. Old Believers remain an important part of Russian religious and cultural history.",

Согласно оценке 2017 года, 37,0% населения Германии не исповедовали никакую религию. Ислам является второй по величине религией в стране. В ходе переписи 2011 года 1,9% населения (1,52 миллиона человек) указали ислам в качестве своей религии, но эти данные считаются недостоверными, поскольку непропорционально большое число последователей этой религии (а также других религий, таких как иудаизм) скорее всего воспользовались своим правом не отвечать на этот вопрос. По данным Религиоведческой информационно-аналитической службы, в 2015 году их число составляло от 4,4 до 4,7 миллионов человек (около 5,5% населения). Исследование, проведенное Федеральным управлением по миграции и беженцам, показало, что с 2011 по 2015 год мусульманское население увеличилось на 1,2 миллиона человек, главным образом за счет иммиграции. Большинство мусульман сунниты и алавиты из Турции, но также есть небольшое число шиитов, ахмадийцев и последователей других течений. К другим религиям, на которые приходится менее одного процента населения Германии, относятся буддизм (270 000 последователей), иудаизм (200 000) и индуизм (около 100 000).

By November-December 1988, most residents of both republics were involved in this conflict, and it effectively outgrew the framework of a local problem of Nagorno-Karabakh, turning into an open interethnic confrontation.\n\nIn 1991-1994, this confrontation led to large-scale military actions for control over Nagorno-Karabakh and some adjacent territories. On May 5, 1994, the Bishkek Protocol on a ceasefire between Armenia and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) on the one hand, and Azerbaijan on the other, was signed.\n\nThe result of the armed conflict was its \"freezing\" and the de facto independence of the NKR from Azerbaijan. 92.5% of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and the so-called \"security zone\" - districts that were not administratively subordinate to the autonomous oblast, but surrounded its territory - came under the control of the NKR. The conflict led to significant ethnic changes in the region. All Azerbaijanis and Kurds living in the zone of combat operations fled, as did almost all Armenians living outside the zone of Armenian control, and almost all Azerbaijanis left Armenia.",

Despite his important role in planning the uprising, Pestel was unable to participate in the event himself as he was arrested a few days before the rebellion due to changes in his plans and schemes.

Under his command, the group inflicted heavy losses on bandit formations and drug trafficker groups. Thus, during one of the ambushes, a three-ton shipment of heroin was intercepted. The bandits put a $300,000 bounty on the officer's head. During his entire service in Tajikistan, Dmitry Razumovsky did not lose a single subordinate.\n\nIn 1993, Razumovsky suffered a severe concussion in one of the battles. While in the hospital, Dmitry learned about the death of his friends from the 12th border guard post - the chief of the guard post, Mikhail Maiboroda, was his best friend. He met his future wife, Erika, at Mikhail's funeral and named his eldest son after him.\n\nIn 1994, Razumovsky was forced to resign from the army after his letter about corruption among the command and the senseless death due to the fault of the higher-ups of Russian border guards and military in Tajikistan was published in several central newspapers.\n\nAfter his resignation, he returned to Ulyanovsk and tried to find his place in civilian life, but unsuccessfully. On recommendation, in October 1996, he was invited to serve in the state security agencies of the Russian Federation. He served as part of Directorate \"V\", better known as the \"Vympel\" group.\n\nTogether with the \"Vympel\" group, Lieutenant Colonel Razumovsky arrived in the city of Beslan, Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, where, on September 1, 2004, a group of thirty-two terrorists under the command of Ruslan Khuchbarov took over a thousand children and adults hostage in School No. 1.\n\nOn the third day of the seizure, explosions occurred in the gym where most of the hostages were held, causing part of the roof to collapse. The surviving hostages began to flee, and Razumovsky's assault group received an order to storm the building. Under heavy fire, Razumovsky directed his subordinates to the enemy's firing points but was fatally shot by a sniper in the schoolyard.\n\nFor courage and heroism shown during the execution of a special assignment, by the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of September 6, 2004, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Aleksandrovich Razumovsky was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation (medal #829).\n\nOn September 7, 2004, Dmitry Razumovsky was buried at the Nikolo-Arkhangelskoye cemetery in Moscow, together with eight other employees of the special forces \"Alpha\" and \"Vympel\" who died during the counter-terrorist operation in Beslan.\n\nIn 2004, a documentary film \"Unknown Soldier. The Last Trip\" dedicated to the memory of D. Razumovsky was released.

After graduating from School No. 1 in Ulyanovsk, Dmitry tried to enter a military school, but did not pass the competition.

He was seriously engaged in sports - in 1985 he became the boxing champion of the USSR among youths.",

He was the commander of the 1st DRP (paratrooper assault guard) of the paratrooper assault maneuver group of the Moscow Border Detachment. He participated in numerous combat operations, for which he was awarded the Order \"For Personal Courage\" and the Medal \"For Courage\". Under his command, the group inflicted heavy losses on bandit formations and drug trafficker groups. Thus, during one of the ambushes, a three-ton shipment of heroin was intercepted. The bandits put a $300,000 bounty on the officer's head. During his entire service in Tajikistan, Dmitry Razumovsky did not lose a single subordinate.\n\nIn 1993, Razumovsky suffered a severe concussion in one of the battles. While in the hospital, Dmitry learned about the death of his friends from the 12th border guard post - the chief of the guard post, Mikhail Mayboroda, was his best friend. He met his future wife, Erika, at Mikhail's funeral and named his eldest son after him.\n\nIn 1994, Razumovsky was forced to resign from the army after his letter about corruption among the command and the senseless death due to the fault of the higher leadership of the Russian border guards and military in Tajikistan was published in a number of central newspapers.\n\nAfter his resignation, he returned to Ulyanovsk and tried to find his place in civilian life, but without success. On recommendation, in October 1996, he was invited to serve in the state security agencies of the Russian Federation. He served in the V Department, better known as the Vympel group.\n\nTogether with the Vympel group, Lieutenant Colonel Razumovsky arrived in the city of Beslan, Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, where, on September 1, 2004, a group of thirty-two terrorists led by Ruslan Khuchbarov took over a thousand children and adults hostage in School No. 1.\n\nOn the third day of the seizure, explosions occurred in the gym where most of the hostages were held, causing part of the roof to collapse. The surviving hostages began to flee, and Razumovsky's assault group received an order to storm the building. Under heavy fire, Razumovsky directed his subordinates to the enemy's firing points but was fatally shot by a sniper in the schoolyard.\n\nFor courage and heroism in the performance of a special assignment, by the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of September 6, 2004, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Aleksandrovich Razumovsky was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation (medal #829).\n\nOn September 7, 2004, Dmitry Razumovsky was buried at the Nikolo-Arkhangelskoye cemetery in Moscow, together with eight other employees of the special forces Alpha and Vympel who died during the counter-terrorist operation in Beslan.\n\nIn 2004, a documentary film \"Unknown Soldier. The Last Trip\" dedicated to the memory of D. Razumovsky was released. On the initiative of a local resident who also participated in the rescue of the hostages, a memorial plaque was installed at the site of Razumovsky's death in Beslan (2011).",

The Oprichniki were Ivan's chosen confidants, endowed with authority and power to terrorize. Their tasks included persecuting and eliminating Ivan the Terrible's enemies, carrying out mass repressions and terror throughout Russia, as well as confiscating property and lands from rivals.\n\nThe Oprichniki wore black clothing and adopted a dog's head and a broom as their symbols, representing their self-proclaimed ability to \"clean\" Russia of enemies and traitors. One of the most notorious and brutal events of this period was the \"Oprichnina\" in Moscow in 1570-1571, when the Oprichniki perpetrated mass murders and looting, resulting in countless victims.\n\nThe Oprichnina lasted only a few years, and in 1572, Ivan the Terrible disbanded the organization, partly due to international and domestic pressures, as well as outrage from a segment of the Russian nobility and clergy.

Its goal was to force the British to negotiate India's independence as quickly as possible. The call for non-violent resistance was made in Mahatma Gandhi's speech \"Do or Die,\" which resonated strongly with the people.\n\nOn August 8, 1942, Gandhi gave a speech in Bombay's Gowalia Tank park, containing words that became the starting point of the campaign, and less than 24 hours later, the main leaders of almost all levels of the Indian National Congress party were arrested and jailed by the British. Gandhi was put under house arrest in the Aga Khan Palace for two years. Other important Congress leaders were imprisoned in Ahmadnagar Fort. The activities of the Congress were banned. As all the leaders of the campaign were arrested, the course of it became uncontrollable. This was followed by mass rallies, demonstrations, and marches, followed by strikes. Soon, there was an increase in violence, with several bomb explosions, destruction and arson of government institutions, power plants being wrecked, and communication nodes being cut, causing chaos in some regions.\n\nThe authorities of British India took repressive measures against the rebels, including mass arrests and heavy monetary fines. Hundreds of people died in the conflict, and more than 100,000 people were detained. Eventually, the movement was crushed, and the remaining free leaders of the campaign were forced to go underground, broadcasting through underground radio stations and distributing pamphlets calling for the continuation of the struggle. Sensing a crisis of their power in India, the British decided to take Gandhi and other prominent Congress leaders aboard a battleship to South Africa or Yemen, but in the end, they did not dare to do so.",
